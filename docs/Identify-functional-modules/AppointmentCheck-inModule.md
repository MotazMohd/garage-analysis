#### Data Flow Highlights

- **Job initiation:** The check-in service produces intake documents, triggers optional upsell recommendations, and either activates an existing job card or creates a new one.
- **Communication trail:** Notifications keep customers informed of arrival status while audit logs preserve evidence and decision points for compliance.
