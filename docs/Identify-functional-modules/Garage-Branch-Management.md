# Step 2: Identify Core Functional Modules

## üîß Module 1: Garage & Branch Management

This module handles the creation, configuration, and access control for garages and their branches within the SaaS system.

üìà **Data Flow Overview:** Review the [Garage & Branch Management Data Flow](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/GarageBranchManagement.md) for a visual walkthrough of who contributes data, which services transform it, and where it ultimately lands.

**Key actors captured in the diagram**

**Data Sources**
- `Garage Admin`: submits the initial configuration and manages branch overrides.
- `SaaS Admin`: triggers the approval workflow and lifecycle changes.
- `Branch Setup Form`: captures per-branch adjustments that piggyback on garage defaults.

**Core Processes**
- `Garage Management Service`: stores pending garages, applies decisions, and seeds default branch values.
- `Approval Console`: surfaces review context so SaaS Admins can approve or reject with reasoning.
- `Branch Management Service`: applies inheritance rules, tracks overrides, and persists branch metadata.
- `Audit Event Bus`: normalizes events from the core services before writing to the append-only audit log.

**Destinations & Stores**
- `Garage Registry DB`: authoritative store for garage state and lifecycle history.
- `Branch Directory DB`: records branch-level overrides and provisioning details.
- `Notification Service`: relays approval results and rejection reasoning back to garage administrators.
- `Audit Log Store` + `Audit Viewer`: retain immutable history and expose the full change log to auditors and admins.
