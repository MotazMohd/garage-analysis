# Step 2: Identify Core Functional Modules

## 🔧 Module 1: Garage & Branch Management

This module handles the creation, configuration, and access control for garages and their branches within the SaaS system.

📈 **Data Flow Overview:** Review the [Garage & Branch Management Data Flow](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/GarageBranchManagement.md) for a visual walkthrough of who contributes data, which services transform it, and where it ultimately lands.

**Key actors captured in the diagram**

**Data Sources**
- `Garage Admin`: submits the initial configuration and manages branch overrides.
- `SaaS Admin`: triggers the approval workflow and lifecycle changes.
- `Branch Setup Form`: captures per-branch adjustments that piggyback on garage defaults.
- `Document Uploads Portal`: secures license, insurance, and compliance attachments alongside the garage request.

**Core Processes**
- `Garage Management Service`: stores pending garages, applies decisions, and seeds default branch values.
- `Approval Console`: surfaces review context so SaaS Admins can approve or reject with reasoning.
- `Branch Management Service`: applies inheritance rules, tracks overrides, and persists branch metadata.
- `Audit Event Bus`: normalizes events from the core services before writing to the append-only audit log.
- `Document Verification Service`: sanitizes uploads, links them to requests, and flags any compliance anomalies for review.

**Destinations & Stores**
- `Garage Registry DB`: authoritative store for garage state and lifecycle history.
- `Branch Directory DB`: records branch-level overrides and provisioning details.
- `Notification Service`: relays approval results and rejection reasoning back to garage administrators.
- `Audit Log Store` + `Audit Viewer`: retain immutable history and expose the full change log to auditors and admins.
- `Document Vault`: preserves the original, sanitized copies of every supporting artifact for audit retrieval.

> 🧭 **How to read the diagram:** follow each row to see how a submission moves from intake, through verification and approval, into provisioning and downstream audit visibility.

### 🔁 Process Highlights

| Stage | Description | Notable Data Paths |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|
| Intake & Classification | Garage Admin submits structured fields while uploading licenses via the Document Portal. | Portal → Document Verification Service → Garage Management Service & Document Vault |
| Approval & Decisioning | SaaS Admin reviews consolidated context, including compliance flags, before approving or rejecting. | Approval Console ↔ Garage Management Service ↔ Audit Event Bus |
| Branch Provisioning | Default branch configuration is cloned and overrides captured via the Branch Setup Form. | Branch Setup Form → Branch Management Service → Branch Directory DB |
| Notifications & Audit | Decisions are broadcast to admins while every event is normalized and archived. | Garage Management Service / Branch Service → Audit Event Bus → Audit Log Store & Viewer |
