# Step 2: Identify Core Functional Modules

## 🔧 Module 1: Garage & Branch Management

This module handles the creation, configuration, and access control for garages and their branches within the SaaS system.

📈 **Data Flow Overview:** Review the [Garage & Branch Management Data Flow](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/GarageBranchManagement.md) for a visual walkthrough of who contributes data, which services transform it, and where it ultimately lands.

The latest revision folds in support, security, resilience, field execution, sustainability oversight, treasury coordination, regulatory filings, insurance reconciliation, revenue intelligence, procurement orchestration, AI governance, marketing intelligence, legal advisory, localization, partner risk analytics, scenario simulation, predictive maintenance, energy optimization, logistics automation, robotics telemetry, innovation governance, global expansion steering, customs compliance workflows, remote assist orchestration, fleet operations telemetry, and investor relations visibility so stakeholders can see how incidents, policy updates, vendor onboarding, facility upkeep, outreach, and compliance attestations intersect with day-to-day garage and branch operations. The newest extension introduces franchise governance councils, tax compliance feeds, loyalty and experiential engagement loops, corporate communications alignment, industry benchmarking signals, smart building telemetry, emergency coordination, capital project oversight, and digital signage orchestration to keep strategic programs synchronized with operational reality.
