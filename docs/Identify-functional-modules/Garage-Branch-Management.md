### üìà Data Flow Diagram

- [Garage & Branch Management data flow](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/GarageBranchManagement.md) ‚Äî visualizes onboarding, approval, branch inheritance, and audit logging across the service.
- [Level 1 data flow decomposition](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level1/GarageBranchManagement-Level1.md) ‚Äî expands the lifecycle into numbered processes for intake, decisioning, branch configuration, access control, and ongoing governance.
- [Level 2 data flow decomposition](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level2/GarageBranchManagement-Level2.md) ‚Äî drills into onboarding, compliance review, branch setup, and staff visibility actions writing to the shared stores and audit ledger.
- [Level 3 service component flow](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level3/GarageBranchManagement-Level3.md) ‚Äî shows the intake portals, compliance desks, lifecycle controllers, and provisioning services interacting with applications, branches, staff directories, and audit stores.
- [Level 4 integration workflow](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level4/GarageBranchManagement-Level4.md) ‚Äî details onboarding intake, document classification, compliance decisions, branch configuration, staff provisioning, and lifecycle enforcement against the platform stores and notification channels.
- [Level 5 infrastructure & observability view](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level5/GarageBranchManagement-Level5.md) ‚Äî maps ingress routing, service mesh sidecars, intake services, document classifiers, risk scoring, compliance desks, lifecycle managers, branch configurators, staff access managers, and observability hooks coordinating through the governance data stores.
- [Level 6 resilience & disaster recovery view](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level6/GarageBranchManagement-Level6.md) ‚Äî highlights geo-redundant onboarding, compliance, branch configuration, staff provisioning, and audit streaming with replicated stores and automated failover runbooks.

#### Data Flow Highlights
- **Registration intake:** Garage admins submit onboarding data and document uploads through the portal, which the service stages in the garages store and mirrors to the audit log for traceability.
- **Approval decisions:** SaaS administrators process pending garages, applying approval or rejection outcomes that update tenant records, notify stakeholders, and append lifecycle entries to the audit trail.
- **Branch lifecycle:** Branch creation executes inheritance rules, captures overrides, synchronises staff visibility, and records each change for compliance reporting.

‚úÖ This completes the extended and finalized configuration for the **Garage & Branch Management module**.
