### 📈 Data Flow Diagram

- [Garage & Branch Management data flow](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/GarageBranchManagement.md) — visualizes onboarding, approval, branch inheritance, and audit logging across the service.

#### Data Flow Highlights
- **Registration intake:** Garage admins submit onboarding data and document uploads through the portal, which the service stages in the garages store and mirrors to the audit log for traceability.
- **Approval decisions:** SaaS administrators process pending garages, applying approval or rejection outcomes that update tenant records, notify stakeholders, and append lifecycle entries to the audit trail.
- **Branch lifecycle:** Branch creation executes inheritance rules, captures overrides, synchronises staff visibility, and records each change for compliance reporting.

✅ This completes the extended and finalized configuration for the **Garage & Branch Management module**.
