## üìà Data Flow Diagram

- [Job card execution data flow](../../Diagrams/DataFlow/JobCardExecution.md) ‚Äî maps technician updates, exception handling, and customer notifications throughout the lifecycle.

#### Data Flow Highlights
- **Work allocation:** Job card services distribute steps to technicians and assistants, who submit progress updates through the execution API.
- **Exception handling:** Blocked steps, missing parts, or QA failures raise escalations that notify managers and enrich the audit trail.
- **Completion signalling:** Approvals release customer notifications and synchronise final job state with downstream systems such as invoicing and analytics.

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

* Technician mobile app for live status updates
* Automatic technician assignment based on AI suggestions
* Version-controlled service templates
* Customer feedback and rating per step
