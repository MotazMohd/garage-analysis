# Step 2: Identify Core Functional Modules

## üîê Module 2: User & Role Management

This module manages how users are created, invited, onboarded, assigned to roles and branches, and how they interact with the system.

### ‚úÖ Role Strategy

- Fixed list of predefined roles (future custom roles possible)
- Each user can have **only one role per branch**
- One user can belong to **multiple branches**, but only **one role per branch**
- Primary Owner role is protected and persistent

#### Predefined Roles (Sample)

| Role                 | Scope        | Description |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Primary Owner        | Garage-wide  | Full control |
| Garage Admin         | Garage-wide  | Manage everything except owner-level changes |
| Branch Manager       | Branch-only  | Schedule, staff, inventory |
| Receptionist         | Branch-only  | Customer bookings, check-ins |
| Technician Leader    | Branch-only  | Assign jobs to technicians |
| Technician           | Branch-only  | Handle assigned tasks |
| Assistant Technician | Branch-only  | Perform task steps, log progress |
| Purchaser            | Branch-only  | Place and manage orders |
| Invoice Manager      | Branch-only  | Billing and receipts |
| Auditor (Read-Only)  | Garage/Branch| No editing rights, full visibility |

### ‚úÖ User Role & Deactivation Rules

- Users are removed entirely if detached from their last branch
- Account is deactivated (no login)
- All historical actions are preserved
- Future: soft-removal or multi-branch access possible

### ‚úÖ Onboarding Methods

| Method           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Admin Invitation | Email/SMS invite with role & branch assignment |
| Self-Registration | Users can sign up, admin approves and assigns them |

- Role-based restrictions on self-registration (e.g., only technicians allowed)
- Admin approval workflow for self-registered users
