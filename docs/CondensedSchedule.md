# 14-Day Condensed Delivery Schedule

This schedule covers tasks 1â€“20 described in the project brief. At least three major tasks are planned per day with parallel execution where feasible.

| Day | Tasks | Dependencies / Parallelism Notes |
| --- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| **1** | 1. Set up Git repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and provision dev/staging/prod environments with a secrets manager. 2. Provision data warehouse/data lake and define initial schemas. 3. Configure Elasticsearch indices and caching infrastructure. 19. Establish initial observability foundations (metrics/logs stack). | Infrastructure tasks run in parallel. Observability tooling installed alongside core environments to instrument subsequent services. |
| **2** | 2. Finalize relational database model and schema governance. 4. Begin Authentication & RBAC service scaffolding. 10. Design ETL pipelines and streaming backbone (Kafka/RabbitMQ). | Auth & ETL design leverage Day 1 infrastructure and schema definitions. Workstreams proceed concurrently with interface contracts agreed upfront. |
| **3** | 5. Develop User & Vehicle CRUD with VIN validation and caching. 12. Implement Notification service (SMS/email providers). 4. Integrate Authentication & RBAC with CRUD workflows. | CRUD depends on Authentication groundwork and caching from Day 1. Notification service wired to Auth for secure messaging; activities executed in parallel sub-teams. |
| **4** | 6. Create Scheduling service with appointment state machine and notifications. 7. Implement WorkOrder service with state transitions. 12. Extend notification templates and hooks for Scheduling/WorkOrder events. | Requires CRUD, Auth, and Notification components from previous days. Teams coordinate shared APIs while developing in parallel. |
| **5** | 8. Build Inventory/Parts service with reservation logic. 9. Develop Supplier service & purchase order workflow. 10. Expand ETL coverage for inventory and supplier events. | Inventory provides data model consumed by Supplier service; close collaboration enables parallel builds. ETL updates capture new domain events. |
| **6** | 11. Integrate payment gateway with HMAC-signed webhooks and idempotency keys. 14. Start plugin registration framework foundation. 8/9. Harden Inventory & Supplier services (validation, error handling). | Payment flows require User and WorkOrder services; plugin framework leverages shared service architecture. Service hardening happens concurrently. |
| **7** | 13. Begin Super Admin dashboard (garage/provider management). 15. Kick off localization (Arabic RTL / English LTR) and WCAG audit. 17. Implement pseudonymization and data-retention processes (data services). | Dashboard consumes completed services. Localization begins with shared UI components. Data governance tasks run alongside UI work. |
| **8** | 13. Continue Super Admin dashboard (marketplace modules, toggles). 16. Launch unit & integration test suites across services. 18. Start training predictive model for parts demand using ETL outputs. | Testing spans previously built services; model training leverages inventory & supplier data. Activities run in parallel with distinct teams. |
| **9** | 16. Conduct performance & security testing and remediate findings. 17. Finalize pseudonymization/data-retention jobs. 19. Configure observability dashboards and SLO-based alerts. | Testing feedback loops into security/data-governance work. Observability tuned with metrics from active services. |
| **10** | 15. Finalize localization & WCAG 2.1 AA compliance fixes. 14. Complete plugin framework developer experience. 18. Refine predictive model and validate against holdout sets. 16. Run regression test sweep after fixes. | Localization depends on completed dashboard UI; plugin work finalizes documentation and tooling. Regression confirms stability ahead of deployments. |
| **11** | 20. Deploy to staging via canary/blue-green strategy and run smoke tests. 16. Address staging issues identified in smoke/regression tests. 12. Finalize localized notification templates and fallbacks. | Staging deployment hinges on prior regression success. Localization of notifications aligned with Day 10 outcomes. |
| **12** | 20. Promote to production with monitored rollout. 19. Finalize observability dashboards and alert routing. 10. Operationalize ETL pipelines (scheduling, monitoring). 18. Integrate predictive model inference into production services. | Production rollout coordinated with observability readiness; ETL and model integration ensure live data availability. |
| **13** | 13. Polish Super Admin dashboard (modules, subscriptions, feature toggles). 14. Monitor plugin registration and partner onboarding. 17. Verify data-retention execution and audit trails. 19. Confirm SLO alerts firing under load tests. | Post-deployment refinements executed in parallel by product, platform, and compliance teams. |
| **14** | 16. Perform final integration, performance, security, and accessibility test pass; resolve critical issues. 18. Validate predictive model performance in production and establish monitoring thresholds. 20. Execute final smoke tests and cut release sign-off. 15. Complete accessibility audit sign-off. | Final assurance gate before project closure; parallel squads handle testing, data science validation, and accessibility certification. |

## Additional Notes
- Staffing assumes domain-focused squads capable of parallel execution.
- Dependencies are met on or before the day a task begins; contingency buffers handled via cross-day overlap.
- Observability (task 19) and testing (task 16) are iterative, with milestones reflected on the days above.
- See the [system data flow overview](../Diagrams/DataFlow/SystemOverview.md) for how these workstreams converge into the unified platform architecture.
- Consult the [Level 1 system decomposition](../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level1/SystemOverview-Level1.md) to understand which data stores and operational services are touched by each milestone.
- Dive into the [Level 2 customer journey](../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level2/SystemOverview-Level2.md) to trace dependencies from booking through billing as they relate to the scheduled deliverables.
- Reference the [Level 3 orchestration services](../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level3/SystemOverview-Level3.md) to align squad responsibilities with the platform services they own.
- Use the [Level 4 integration workflow](../Diagrams/DataFlow/Level4/SystemOverview-Level4.md) when planning infrastructure or release steps that depend on authentication, data planes, and event streaming.
