# 14-Day Condensed Delivery Schedule

This schedule covers tasks 1–20 described in the project brief. At least three major tasks are planned per day with parallel execution where feasible.

## Planning Assumptions
- Four cross-functional squads (Platform, Core Services, Experience, and Data/ML) are available and can swarm when a task requires extra capacity.
- Shared enabling work (e.g., observability, testing frameworks) is front-loaded so dependent teams can operate autonomously by mid-schedule.
- Daily checkpoints ensure hand-offs (API contracts, schema changes, feature flags) are signed off before downstream teams begin their work the following morning.
- Buffer for unexpected findings is absorbed by staggering testing and hardening across multiple days rather than at the end.

| Day | Tasks | Dependencies / Parallelism Notes |
| --- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| **1** | 1. Set up Git repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and provision dev/staging/prod environments with a secrets manager. 2. Provision data warehouse/data lake and define initial schemas. 3. Configure Elasticsearch indices and caching infrastructure. 19. Establish initial observability foundations (metrics/logs stack). | Infrastructure tasks run in parallel. Observability tooling installed alongside core environments to instrument subsequent services. |
| **2** | 2. Finalize relational database model and schema governance. 4. Begin Authentication & RBAC service scaffolding. 10. Design ETL pipelines and streaming backbone (Kafka/RabbitMQ). | Auth & ETL design leverage Day 1 infrastructure and schema definitions. Workstreams proceed concurrently with interface contracts agreed upfront. |
| **3** | 5. Develop User & Vehicle CRUD with VIN validation and caching. 12. Implement Notification service (SMS/email providers). 4. Integrate Authentication & RBAC with CRUD workflows. | CRUD depends on Authentication groundwork and caching from Day 1. Notification service wired to Auth for secure messaging; activities executed in parallel sub-teams. |
| **4** | 6. Create Scheduling service with appointment state machine and notifications. 7. Implement WorkOrder service with state transitions. 12. Extend notification templates and hooks for Scheduling/WorkOrder events. | Requires CRUD, Auth, and Notification components from previous days. Teams coordinate shared APIs while developing in parallel. |
| **5** | 8. Build Inventory/Parts service with reservation logic. 9. Develop Supplier service & purchase order workflow. 10. Expand ETL coverage for inventory and supplier events. | Inventory provides data model consumed by Supplier service; close collaboration enables parallel builds. ETL updates capture new domain events. |
| **6** | 11. Integrate payment gateway with HMAC-signed webhooks and idempotency keys. 14. Start plugin registration framework foundation. 8/9. Harden Inventory & Supplier services (validation, error handling). | Payment flows require User and WorkOrder services; plugin framework leverages shared service architecture. Service hardening happens concurrently. |
| **7** | 13. Begin Super Admin dashboard (garage/provider management). 15. Kick off localization (Arabic RTL / English LTR) and WCAG audit. 17. Implement pseudonymization and data-retention processes (data services). | Dashboard consumes completed services. Localization begins with shared UI components. Data governance tasks run alongside UI work. |
| **8** | 13. Continue Super Admin dashboard (marketplace modules, toggles). 16. Launch unit & integration test suites across services. 18. Start training predictive model for parts demand using ETL outputs. | Testing spans previously built services; model training leverages inventory & supplier data. Activities run in parallel with distinct teams. |
| **9** | 16. Conduct performance & security testing and remediate findings. 17. Finalize pseudonymization/data-retention jobs. 19. Configure observability dashboards and SLO-based alerts. | Testing feedback loops into security/data-governance work. Observability tuned with metrics from active services. |
| **10** | 15. Finalize localization & WCAG 2.1 AA compliance fixes. 14. Complete plugin framework developer experience. 18. Refine predictive model and validate against holdout sets. 16. Run regression test sweep after fixes. | Localization depends on completed dashboard UI; plugin work finalizes documentation and tooling. Regression confirms stability ahead of deployments. |
| **11** | 20. Deploy to staging via canary/blue-green strategy and run smoke tests. 16. Address staging issues identified in smoke/regression tests. 12. Finalize localized notification templates and fallbacks. | Staging deployment hinges on prior regression success. Localization of notifications aligned with Day 10 outcomes. |
| **12** | 20. Promote to production with monitored rollout. 19. Finalize observability dashboards and alert routing. 10. Operationalize ETL pipelines (scheduling, monitoring). 18. Integrate predictive model inference into production services. | Production rollout coordinated with observability readiness; ETL and model integration ensure live data availability. |
| **13** | 13. Polish Super Admin dashboard (modules, subscriptions, feature toggles). 14. Monitor plugin registration and partner onboarding. 17. Verify data-retention execution and audit trails. 19. Confirm SLO alerts firing under load tests. | Post-deployment refinements executed in parallel by product, platform, and compliance teams. |
| **14** | 16. Perform final integration, performance, security, and accessibility test pass; resolve critical issues. 18. Validate predictive model performance in production and establish monitoring thresholds. 20. Execute final smoke tests and cut release sign-off. 15. Complete accessibility audit sign-off. | Final assurance gate before project closure; parallel squads handle testing, data science validation, and accessibility certification. |

- **Data & Intelligence:** Handles tasks 2, 10, 17, and 18, providing schemas, ETL, governance, and predictive insights.
- **Quality & Compliance:** Drives task 16 with continuous testing, feeding results back to all squads for remediation.

## Additional Notes
- Dependencies are met on or before the day a task begins; contingency buffers handled via cross-day overlap and daily checkpoints.
- Observability (task 19) and testing (task 16) are iterative, with milestones reflected on the days above.
- Canary/blue-green deployments are rehearsed in lower environments on Days 9–10 to derisk the Day 11 cutover.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Confirm staffing and ownership.** Validate that every task in the schedule has a directly accountable lead (product, engineering, QA, data) and supporting contributors identified.
2. **Baseline backlog readiness.** Ensure epics and stories for the first three days are refined, estimated, and accepted into the sprint board; schedule just-in-time grooming for subsequent days.
3. **Finalize environment access.** Distribute credentials for CI/CD, cloud environments, secrets manager, and analytics tooling so squads can start on Day 1 without blockers.
4. **Establish communication cadence.** Book daily cross-squad stand-ups, end-of-day check-ins, and a twice-weekly steering review with executive stakeholders.
5. **Set up progress tracking.** Align on burndown dashboards, risk registers, and dependency trackers that will be updated at each checkpoint.

## Risk Radar and Mitigations
- **Environment provisioning delays:** Pre-stage infrastructure automation scripts and secure cloud quotas; assign a dedicated platform engineer on call for rapid triage.
- **Cross-squad contract churn:** Require signed API/schema contracts before development starts; maintain a shared specification repository with versioning and approval workflow.
- **Third-party integrations (payments, messaging):** Schedule early sandbox validation (Days 6–7) and have fallback providers or manual procedures documented.
- **Testing fatigue in condensed timeline:** Rotate QA responsibilities across squads and enforce automated regression suites from Day 8 onward to reduce manual overhead.
- **Localization & accessibility surprises:** Engage accessibility specialists from Day 7 and allocate buffer stories for remediation discovered during audits.

## Governance & Reporting
- **Daily stand-up (30 min):** Representatives from each squad share progress, risks, and cross-team requests.
- **End-of-day checkpoint (15 min async):** Update shared status doc with completed tasks, outstanding issues, and ETA adjustments.
- **Steering committee (Tue/Fri):** Review milestone health, budget impacts, and approve scope changes or contingency plans.
- **Risk & decision log:** Capture mitigation owners and due dates; review during steering sessions.

## Post-Day-14 Follow Through
- **Hypercare window (Week 3):** Keep core squads on pager rotation for production monitoring, ticket triage, and fast patching.
- **Retrospective & lessons learned:** Run a cross-functional retro to capture process improvements and tooling gaps for future releases.
- **Roadmap alignment:** Use outcomes from the schedule to update the quarterly roadmap, focusing on enhancements, model retraining cadence, and plugin ecosystem growth.
- **Operational hand-off:** Transition runbooks, dashboards, and on-call rotations to the operations/support organization with sign-offs on SLAs and escalation paths.
