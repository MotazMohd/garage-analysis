# 14-Day Condensed Delivery Schedule

This schedule covers tasks 1–20 described in the project brief. At least three major tasks are planned per day with parallel execution where feasible.

## Planning Assumptions
- Four cross-functional squads (Platform, Core Services, Experience, and Data/ML) are available and can swarm when a task requires extra capacity.
- Shared enabling work (e.g., observability, testing frameworks) is front-loaded so dependent teams can operate autonomously by mid-schedule.
- Daily checkpoints ensure hand-offs (API contracts, schema changes, feature flags) are signed off before downstream teams begin their work the following morning.
- Buffer for unexpected findings is absorbed by staggering testing and hardening across multiple days rather than at the end.

| Day | Tasks | Dependencies / Parallelism Notes |
| --- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| **1** | 1. Set up Git repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and provision dev/staging/prod environments with a secrets manager. 2. Provision data warehouse/data lake and define initial schemas. 3. Configure Elasticsearch indices and caching infrastructure. 19. Establish initial observability foundations (metrics/logs stack). | Infrastructure tasks run in parallel. Observability tooling installed alongside core environments to instrument subsequent services. |
| **2** | 2. Finalize relational database model and schema governance. 4. Begin Authentication & RBAC service scaffolding. 10. Design ETL pipelines and streaming backbone (Kafka/RabbitMQ). | Auth & ETL design leverage Day 1 infrastructure and schema definitions. Workstreams proceed concurrently with interface contracts agreed upfront. |
| **3** | 5. Develop User & Vehicle CRUD with VIN validation and caching. 12. Implement Notification service (SMS/email providers). 4. Integrate Authentication & RBAC with CRUD workflows. | CRUD depends on Authentication groundwork and caching from Day 1. Notification service wired to Auth for secure messaging; activities executed in parallel sub-teams. |
| **4** | 6. Create Scheduling service with appointment state machine and notifications. 7. Implement WorkOrder service with state transitions. 12. Extend notification templates and hooks for Scheduling/WorkOrder events. | Requires CRUD, Auth, and Notification components from previous days. Teams coordinate shared APIs while developing in parallel. |
| **5** | 8. Build Inventory/Parts service with reservation logic. 9. Develop Supplier service & purchase order workflow. 10. Expand ETL coverage for inventory and supplier events. | Inventory provides data model consumed by Supplier service; close collaboration enables parallel builds. ETL updates capture new domain events. |
| **6** | 11. Integrate payment gateway with HMAC-signed webhooks and idempotency keys. 14. Start plugin registration framework foundation. 8/9. Harden Inventory & Supplier services (validation, error handling). | Payment flows require User and WorkOrder services; plugin framework leverages shared service architecture. Service hardening happens concurrently. |
| **7** | 13. Begin Super Admin dashboard (garage/provider management). 15. Kick off localization (Arabic RTL / English LTR) and WCAG audit. 17. Implement pseudonymization and data-retention processes (data services). | Dashboard consumes completed services. Localization begins with shared UI components. Data governance tasks run alongside UI work. |
| **8** | 13. Continue Super Admin dashboard (marketplace modules, toggles). 16. Launch unit & integration test suites across services. 18. Start training predictive model for parts demand using ETL outputs. | Testing spans previously built services; model training leverages inventory & supplier data. Activities run in parallel with distinct teams. |
| **9** | 16. Conduct performance & security testing and remediate findings. 17. Finalize pseudonymization/data-retention jobs. 19. Configure observability dashboards and SLO-based alerts. | Testing feedback loops into security/data-governance work. Observability tuned with metrics from active services. |
| **10** | 15. Finalize localization & WCAG 2.1 AA compliance fixes. 14. Complete plugin framework developer experience. 18. Refine predictive model and validate against holdout sets. 16. Run regression test sweep after fixes. | Localization depends on completed dashboard UI; plugin work finalizes documentation and tooling. Regression confirms stability ahead of deployments. |
| **11** | 20. Deploy to staging via canary/blue-green strategy and run smoke tests. 16. Address staging issues identified in smoke/regression tests. 12. Finalize localized notification templates and fallbacks. | Staging deployment hinges on prior regression success. Localization of notifications aligned with Day 10 outcomes. |
| **12** | 20. Promote to production with monitored rollout. 19. Finalize observability dashboards and alert routing. 10. Operationalize ETL pipelines (scheduling, monitoring). 18. Integrate predictive model inference into production services. | Production rollout coordinated with observability readiness; ETL and model integration ensure live data availability. |
| **13** | 13. Polish Super Admin dashboard (modules, subscriptions, feature toggles). 14. Monitor plugin registration and partner onboarding. 17. Verify data-retention execution and audit trails. 19. Confirm SLO alerts firing under load tests. | Post-deployment refinements executed in parallel by product, platform, and compliance teams. |
| **14** | 16. Perform final integration, performance, security, and accessibility test pass; resolve critical issues. 18. Validate predictive model performance in production and establish monitoring thresholds. 20. Execute final smoke tests and cut release sign-off. 15. Complete accessibility audit sign-off. | Final assurance gate before project closure; parallel squads handle testing, data science validation, and accessibility certification. |

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Confirm staffing and ownership.** Validate that every task in the schedule has a directly accountable lead (product, engineering, QA, data) and supporting contributors identified.
2. **Baseline backlog readiness.** Ensure epics and stories for the first three days are refined, estimated, and accepted into the sprint board; schedule just-in-time grooming for subsequent days.
3. **Finalize environment access.** Distribute credentials for CI/CD, cloud environments, secrets manager, and analytics tooling so squads can start on Day 1 without blockers.
4. **Establish communication cadence.** Book daily cross-squad stand-ups, end-of-day check-ins, and a twice-weekly steering review with executive stakeholders.
5. **Set up progress tracking.** Align on burndown dashboards, risk registers, and dependency trackers that will be updated at each checkpoint.

## Risk Radar and Mitigations
- **Environment provisioning delays:** Pre-stage infrastructure automation scripts and secure cloud quotas; assign a dedicated platform engineer on call for rapid triage.
- **Cross-squad contract churn:** Require signed API/schema contracts before development starts; maintain a shared specification repository with versioning and approval workflow.
- **Third-party integrations (payments, messaging):** Schedule early sandbox validation (Days 6–7) and have fallback providers or manual procedures documented.
- **Testing fatigue in condensed timeline:** Rotate QA responsibilities across squads and enforce automated regression suites from Day 8 onward to reduce manual overhead.
- **Localization & accessibility surprises:** Engage accessibility specialists from Day 7 and allocate buffer stories for remediation discovered during audits.

## Governance & Reporting
- **Daily stand-up (30 min):** Representatives from each squad share progress, risks, and cross-team requests.
- **End-of-day checkpoint (15 min async):** Update shared status doc with completed tasks, outstanding issues, and ETA adjustments.
- **Steering committee (Tue/Fri):** Review milestone health, budget impacts, and approve scope changes or contingency plans.
- **Risk & decision log:** Capture mitigation owners and due dates; review during steering sessions.

## Post-Day-14 Follow Through
- **Hypercare window (Week 3):** Keep core squads on pager rotation for production monitoring, ticket triage, and fast patching.
- **Retrospective & lessons learned:** Run a cross-functional retro to capture process improvements and tooling gaps for future releases.
- **Roadmap alignment:** Use outcomes from the schedule to update the quarterly roadmap, focusing on enhancements, model retraining cadence, and plugin ecosystem growth.
- **Operational hand-off:** Transition runbooks, dashboards, and on-call rotations to the operations/support organization with sign-offs on SLAs and escalation paths.

## Proceeding Next: Day 0 Kickoff Playbook
- **Kickoff session agenda (90 minutes):**
  1. Reconfirm objectives, success metrics, and non-negotiable scope.
  2. Walk through the 14-day plan, highlighting critical dependencies and integration checkpoints.
  3. Review risk radar items, assign owners, and capture new issues raised during the meeting.
  4. Lock communication cadences, escalation paths, and decision-making authority (who signs off what and when).
  5. Validate tooling readiness (CI/CD, observability, shared documentation spaces) and align on how to request access help.
- **Backlog burn-down setup:** Ensure each squad has sprint boards seeded with Day 1–3 stories, acceptance criteria, and Definition of Done checklists; load cross-team dependencies into the shared dependency tracker.
- **Decision & risk registers:** Stand up a shared workspace (e.g., Confluence/Notion) with templates for logging decisions, open questions, and mitigation status to maintain transparency across squads.
- **Engineering enablement checklist:** Confirm feature flag framework, secrets management policies, coding standards, and branching strategy are documented and acknowledged by all contributors before development begins.
- **Stakeholder alignment:** Circulate a kickoff digest summarizing deliverables, meeting cadence, and escalation triggers to executive sponsors and adjacent teams (support, finance, legal).

## Workstream Scorecard & Reporting Cadence
