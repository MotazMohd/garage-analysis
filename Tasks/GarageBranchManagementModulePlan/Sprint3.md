# üõ°Ô∏è Sprint 3: Governance, Insights & Integrations

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Harden garage and branch management with automation, analytics, and ecosystem integrations that power downstream workflows.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Lifecycle Automation & Policy Hooks
- Introduce automated suspension rules (e.g., unpaid invoices, missing documents) via policy engine.
- Allow SaaS admins to configure policy thresholds and notifications.
- Publish events when automation triggers state changes for observability.
- **Why:** Reduces manual oversight and protects platform compliance.

### 2. Advanced Audit & Timeline Views
- Build chronological timeline per garage/branch capturing approvals, overrides, document updates, staff changes.
- Provide filterable audit API for auditors with export capability.
- Highlight high-risk actions (ownership transfer, mass branch edits) with secondary approval option.
- **Why:** Enhances transparency for governance and dispute resolution.

### 3. Health Dashboards & Alerts
- Create dashboards summarising branch status, document expiry risk, operational hours coverage, and staff distribution.
- Implement alerting (email/in-app) for anomalies: branch closed > X days, missing working hours, repeated suspensions.
- Integrate metrics into observability stack for SLA tracking.
- **Why:** Gives operators proactive insight into tenant health.

### 4. Downstream Module Integrations
- Expose read models for scheduling, billing, collaboration modules (e.g., GraphQL endpoints or cached views).
- Ensure branch status and working hours updates propagate to appointments, job cards, and invoice modules.
- Provide webhook subscriptions for partner integrations (e.g., marketplaces, insurers).
- **Why:** Keeps the wider platform aligned with accurate garage metadata.

### 5. Data Residency & Localization Enhancements
- Support per-country data residency flags to route storage appropriately.
- Extend localisation to include currency/tax presets and multi-language garage descriptions.
- Update onboarding flows to respect locale-specific compliance checklists.
- **Why:** Positions the platform for expansion across Middle East markets with regulatory alignment.

## üìå Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Policy engine can auto-suspend/reactivate garages based on configured rules with audit entries.
- [ ] Audit timeline exposes filterable events and export for auditors.
- [ ] Dashboards and alerts highlight branch/garage health metrics with actionable insights.
- [ ] Downstream modules receive timely updates when garage or branch data changes.
- [ ] Localisation and data residency rules apply during onboarding and updates.

## üîó Dependencies
- Observability stack for metrics and alerting.
- Billing/finance service for delinquency signals.
- Messaging/webhook infrastructure for integrations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-aggressive automation disrupting operations | Provide simulation mode and manual override, plus notifications before enforcement. |
| Audit data volume impacting performance | Partition audit tables per tenant and archive older entries to cold storage. |
| Integration drift between modules | Define contract tests and schema versioning for shared models/events. |

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Effort
| Area | Time |
|------|------|
| Automation & policy engine | 2 days |
| Dashboards & analytics | 2 days |
| Integrations & localisation | 1.5 days |
| QA/UAT | 1 day |

**Total:** ~6.5 dev days

## ‚úÖ Sprint Outcome
- Governance automation keeps garage data trustworthy with minimal manual effort.
- Operators monitor network health and act on insights quickly.
- Garage context flows seamlessly into other modules and partner integrations.
