# 🏢 Garage & Branch Management Module — Delivery Plan

## 🎯 Epic Objective
Provide a compliant, multi-branch tenant administration experience so new garages can onboard smoothly, configure branches, and manage staff visibility with the right controls from day one.

---

## 🚀 Sprint 1: Tenant Onboarding Foundations
- Stand up garage master data, approval workflows, and owner/admin management.
- Enable garage-level settings for working hours, service capabilities, and compliance documents.
- Outcome: SaaS admins can approve well-structured garage tenants while primary owners gain the tools to manage their organisation.

## 🏬 Sprint 2: Branch Operations & Staff Controls
- Deliver branch inheritance rules, overrides, and cross-branch user assignment.
- Introduce configurable branch templates, custom fields, and document management per site.
- Outcome: Multi-branch garages can model their footprint accurately and control who sees what.

## 🛡️ Sprint 3: Governance, Insights & Integrations
- Expand audit trails, status automation, and analytics for garage/branch health.
- Wire garage data into downstream modules (scheduling, billing, collaboration) with policy hooks.
- Outcome: Operators gain real-time oversight, proactive alerts, and smooth integrations across the platform.

## 📋 Cross-Cutting Considerations
| Topic | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Security & Permissions** | Restrict garage CRUD to SaaS Admins; Garage Admins manage their tenant per role matrix. |
| **Localization** | Support Arabic/English labels, regional timezones, and currency defaults at garage level. |
| **Data Governance** | Enforce audit logs on status changes, working hours, and ownership transfers. |
| **Scalability** | Index garages/branches by geography and status for fast search and dashboard filtering. |
| **Integrations** | Emit lifecycle events (`garage.approved`, `branch.updated`) for billing, notification, and reporting services. |

## ⏱️ Total Estimated Effort
| Sprint | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Sprint 1 | ~6 dev days |
| Sprint 2 | ~6.5 dev days |
| Sprint 3 | ~6.5 dev days |

**Overall:** ~19 dev days across the first three sprints.
