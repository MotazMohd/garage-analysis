# ðŸ“Š Reports & Dashboards â€” Sprint 1 Plan (Analytics Foundations)

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal
Establish a governed reporting environment with trusted metrics, enabling leadership to view consistent revenue and operational performance across all garages.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Key Deliverables
1. **Analytics Data Model & Warehouse Setup**
   - Design star schemas for `JobPerformance`, `RevenueSummary`, `TechnicianUtilization`, and `InventoryTurns` facts.
   - Configure ETL pipelines pulling from job cards, invoicing, inventory, and customer domains into a reporting database.
   - Implement slowly changing dimensions for branches, services, and customer segments.
2. **Metric Contracts & Validation Harness**
   - Document KPIs with formulas, update frequency, owners, and acceptable thresholds.
   - Build automated validation jobs comparing warehouse aggregates against operational system snapshots.
   - Surface data quality dashboards showing pass/fail status per metric.
3. **Baseline Executive Dashboards**
   - Deliver executive overview dashboards (web) with revenue trends, job throughput, and technician capacity.
   - Implement branch filter, date ranges, and export to PDF/image for leadership reviews.
   - Provide responsive design for tablet viewing during on-site visits.
4. **Access Control & Audit Logging**
   - Integrate dashboards with role-based access inheriting from SaaS permission service.
   - Enforce branch-level row security to prevent cross-garage data leakage.
   - Log dashboard access events for audit and adoption analytics.
5. **Infrastructure & Monitoring**
   - Provision scheduled ETL orchestration with retry/alerting policies.
   - Monitor query performance, storage costs, and refresh latency with observability dashboards.
   - Establish data retention policies and archival strategy for historical snapshots.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- Warehouse schemas deployed with documented lineage and version control.
- KPI validation pipeline runs nightly and flags discrepancies >1%. 
- Executive dashboard surfaces accurate data within 1 hour of ETL completion.
- Access policies verified: users only see authorized branches and interactions captured in audit logs.
- Observability alerts trigger on ETL failure, refresh latency breaches, and slow dashboard queries.

---

## ðŸ”„ Dependencies & Collaboration
- **Job Cards, Invoice & Billing, Inventory teams:** Provide API contracts and change notifications for data extraction.
- **Security & Identity:** Configure SSO tokens and RBAC groups for analytics tooling.
- **Finance & Operations Leadership:** Review metric definitions and baseline dashboard layouts.

---

## ðŸ§® Estimated Effort
- **Data Engineering:** ~6 dev days (warehouse design, ETL, monitoring).
- **Front-end/Analytics:** ~3 dev days (dashboard build, filters, exports).
- **QA & Data Validation:** ~2 dev days (metric reconciliation, access testing).
- **Total:** ~11 dev days.
