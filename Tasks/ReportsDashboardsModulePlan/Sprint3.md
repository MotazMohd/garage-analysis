# ðŸ“Š Reports & Dashboards â€” Sprint 3 Plan (Predictive Intelligence)

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal
Introduce forward-looking analytics, governed self-service capabilities, and embedded insights that empower every team to act proactively.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Key Deliverables
1. **Predictive & Anomaly Detection Models**
   - Train forecasting models for revenue, job demand, and inventory consumption using historical trends and seasonal factors.
   - Detect anomalies in technician utilization, NPS, and billing cycles with automated incident routing.
   - Visualize forecasts vs. actuals with confidence intervals and recommended actions.
2. **Self-Service Analytics Workspace**
   - Launch governed dataset catalog with metadata, sample queries, and certification badges.
   - Provide drag-and-drop dashboard builder with saved filters, parameters, and share links.
   - Enforce row-level and column-level security inherited from RBAC policies.
3. **Embedded & Mobile Insights**
   - Embed key widgets into technician and customer mobile apps with offline caching support.
   - Offer contextual insights inside job cards, appointments, and purchase order screens.
   - Implement event tracking to measure usage and outcomes from embedded components.
4. **Advanced Alerting & What-If Analysis**
   - Enable predictive alerts that flag forecast deviations before SLA breach.
   - Provide what-if simulators for staffing levels, spare part procurement, and pricing adjustments.
   - Store scenario assumptions and shareable summaries for decision review.
5. **Adoption & Change Enablement**
   - Roll out analytics community of practice, office hours, and certification path.
   - Deliver in-app walkthroughs, knowledge base updates, and feedback widgets.
   - Capture adoption KPIs (MAU, report creation, alert resolutions) and share with leadership.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- Forecast models achieve agreed accuracy thresholds (e.g., MAPE <10% for revenue) in backtesting.
- Anomaly alerts triggered and routed to correct teams with acknowledgment tracking.
- Self-service workspace enforces governance rules; unauthorized data access attempts blocked and logged.
- Embedded dashboards load within mobile performance budgets and degrade gracefully offline.
- Adoption metrics reported weekly with insights on engagement, feedback, and action follow-up.

## ðŸ”„ Dependencies & Collaboration
- **Data Science Team:** Partner on model selection, evaluation, and deployment pipeline.
- **Mobile & Web App Teams:** Integrate embedded widgets and ensure performance budgets.
- **Change Management & Training:** Coordinate enablement programs and communication cadence.

---

## ðŸ§® Estimated Effort
- **Data Science & Engineering:** ~6 dev days (modeling, predictive alerts, governance enforcement).
- **Front-end/Embedded:** ~4 dev days (widget integration, self-service UI enhancements).
- **Adoption & Analytics Ops:** ~2.5 dev days (training assets, instrumentation, reporting).
- **Total:** ~12.5 dev days.
