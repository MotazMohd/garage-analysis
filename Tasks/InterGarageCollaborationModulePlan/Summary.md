# 🤝 Inter-Garage Collaboration Module Overview

## 🌟 Vision
Empower garages to safely discover, request, and fulfill shared resources across a trusted network so parts, tools, and specialty services can flow to the right branch without disrupting daily operations or compliance.

---

## 🧩 Sprint Breakdown
- **Sprint 1 – Network Foundations:** Stand up the partner registry, access controls, and catalog-sharing contracts that expose limited inventory and capability signals.
- **Sprint 2 – Fulfillment & Settlement:** Enable cross-garage requests for parts, tools, and service outsourcing with logistics tracking, payments, and dispute resolution.
- **Sprint 3 – Intelligence & Marketplace:** Layer optimization, forecasting, and partner enablement features to scale the collaboration marketplace with confidence.

---

## 🔄 Cross-Cutting Considerations
- **Trust & Compliance:** Vet partners, track agreements, and maintain audit logs for every collaboration action with tenant-level governance knobs.
- **Data Minimization:** Share only the attributes required to evaluate a request, enforcing masking and per-field visibility policies.
- **Localization & Currency:** Respect branch currencies, VAT rules, and bilingual communications across markets.
- **Security & Networking:** Apply scoped API keys, IP allow lists, and throttling to protect shared endpoints from abuse.
- **Change Management:** Provide enablement collateral, rollout toggles, and monitoring dashboards so operators can adopt the network safely.
