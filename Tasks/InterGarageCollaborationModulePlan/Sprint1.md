# üöÄ Sprint 1: Partner Network Foundations

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Establish the collaboration network baseline with vetted partner onboarding, scoped data sharing, and discovery experiences so garages can see trusted resources without exposing sensitive operations.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Partner Registry & Agreement Tracking
- **Entities:** Create `PartnerGarage`, `PartnerAgreement`, and `PartnerCapability` tables with tenant- and branch-level scope.
- **Workflow:** Support invite, approval, suspension, and termination flows with digital agreement storage.
- **Why:** Provides a governed roster of partners each garage is willing to collaborate with and the terms that apply.

### 2. Access Control & Visibility Policies
- **Controls:** Define visibility tiers (public marketplace, trusted partner, private) and map to RBAC roles and branch scopes.
- **API Keys:** Issue scoped tokens with rate limits, IP allow lists, and rotation reminders for shared APIs.
- **Why:** Ensures only authorized parties can view or request shared inventory, protecting business-sensitive data.

### 3. Shared Catalog Publishing Contracts
- **Interfaces:** Design versioned REST/GraphQL endpoints for exposing limited inventory, tool availability, and service capability snippets.
- **Normalization:** Apply unit, currency, and localization transformers before data leaves the owning tenant.
- **Why:** Establishes consistent contracts that partners can consume without reverse engineering internal schemas.

### 4. Partner Discovery Experience
- **UI:** Build search and filter UI across partner garages, resources, and service competencies with bilingual support.
- **Signals:** Display availability indicators, response time SLAs, and contractual notes without revealing sensitive pricing.
- **Why:** Helps operators decide which partner to approach quickly and confidently.

### 5. Audit Logging & Observability
- **Logging:** Capture partner onboarding, catalog publication, and discovery events with user IDs and timestamps.
- **Monitoring:** Add dashboards and alerts for unusual request volume or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Why:** Maintains trust in the network and surfaces misuse early.

## üìå Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Garages can invite, approve, or suspend partner garages with agreements stored and versioned.
- [ ] Access policies restrict catalog visibility to authorized partners with scoped API credentials and rate limits enforced.
- [ ] Shared catalog endpoints return normalized data for inventory, tools, and services using documented schemas.
- [ ] Partner discovery UI lists approved partners with localized filters and key availability signals.
- [ ] Audit logs and monitoring dashboards capture partner lifecycle and discovery activity for compliance review.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Effort
| Area | Time |
|------|------|
| Partner registry & agreements | 1.5 days |
| Access controls & API security | 1.2 days |
| Catalog contracts | 1.1 days |
| Discovery UI | 1.2 days |
| Audit & observability | 0.5 days |

**Total:** ~5.5 dev days

## ‚úÖ Sprint Outcome
- Garages build a trusted partner roster with the guardrails and logging required for compliance.
- Only vetted partners see limited catalog data, exposed through consistent APIs that respect localization rules.
- Operators can search the network confidently knowing activity is monitored and governed.
