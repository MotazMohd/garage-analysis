## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Cross-Garage Request Lifecycle
- **Request Types:** Support `PartTransfer`, `ToolLoan`, and `ServiceOutsource` with shared request metadata.
- **Workflow:** Implement submission, partner acknowledgment, negotiation (quantity, dates, pricing), and acceptance flows with SLA timers.
- **Why:** Standardizes how collaboration deals are created and tracked through fulfillment.

### 2. Logistics & Handoff Tracking
- **Scheduling:** Allow pickup/delivery slot selection with carrier assignments and branch pickup instructions.
- **Telemetry:** Track status updates (ready, in transit, received, returned) with timestamps and proof-of-handoff uploads.
- **Why:** Provides operational visibility so teams know where resources are and when they will arrive or return.

### 3. Settlement & Billing Controls
- **Invoicing:** Generate inter-garage invoices/credits with configurable pricing models (flat fee, cost-plus, usage-based).
- **Payments:** Integrate with existing billing module for ledger entries, VAT handling, and optional escrow for high-value transfers.
- **Why:** Ensures collaboration deals impact financials accurately and comply with tax regulations.

### 4. Issue Resolution & Dispute Management
- **Case Handling:** Allow parties to open disputes with reason codes, attach evidence, and assign resolution owners.
- **SLA:** Track response and resolution times with escalation notifications to admins.
- **Why:** Keeps trust intact by providing structured remediation when something goes wrong.

### 5. Communication & Audit Enhancements
- **Notifications:** Send templated updates (request status, logistics changes, settlement posted) across email, in-app, and SMS where enabled.
- **Audit:** Expand logging to capture negotiation edits, settlement adjustments, and dispute outcomes with immutable history.
- **Why:** Maintains transparency across both operational and financial events.
