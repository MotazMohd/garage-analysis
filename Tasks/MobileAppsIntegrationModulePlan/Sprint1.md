# üöÄ Sprint 1: Mobile Foundations

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Launch secure, brand-aligned technician and customer mobile applications that mirror core desktop workflows for viewing schedules, job cards, and customer information, while establishing the infrastructure for real-time updates.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Mobile Architecture & Authentication
- **App Shells:** Scaffold React Native (or Flutter) projects for technician and customer apps with shared design system components.
- **Identity:** Integrate OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect login, enforce MFA for technicians, and support biometric unlock on compatible devices.
- **Session Management:** Implement refresh token rotation, secure storage (Keychain/Keystore), and remote logout support.
- **Why:** Provides hardened, reusable foundations for all future mobile workflows.

### 2. Core Data Sync & APIs
- **Mobile Gateways:** Expose mobile-optimized endpoints for job cards, appointments, and customer profiles with pagination and ETag caching.
- **Offline Strategy:** Add delta-sync services, background refresh queues, and conflict resolution rules for low-connectivity environments.
- **Data Models:** Align mobile DTOs with existing service contracts; include localization metadata for copy and currency.
- **Why:** Ensures technicians and customers can reliably access critical data wherever they are.

### 3. Navigation & Home Dashboards
- **Technician Home:** Display assigned jobs, upcoming appointments, and action shortcuts (check-in, start job).
- **Customer Home:** Show upcoming bookings, vehicle summaries, and quick actions (reschedule, contact garage).
- **UI Framework:** Apply responsive layout primitives, dark/light mode, and accessibility baseline (WCAG AA).
- **Why:** Delivers intuitive entry points that drive engagement with high-value tasks.

### 4. Notifications & Preferences
- **Push Infrastructure:** Connect to APNs/FCM, generate device tokens, and send smoke-test notifications from staging.
- **Event Routing:** Subscribe to job status, appointment changes, and promotional campaigns from the event bus.
- **User Controls:** Provide in-app notification preferences aligned with consent regulations (GDPR/CCPA).
- **Why:** Keeps users informed in real time while respecting communication choices.
