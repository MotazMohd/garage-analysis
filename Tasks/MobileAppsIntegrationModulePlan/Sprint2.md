# üîÑ Sprint 2: Workflow Deepening

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Empower technicians to execute end-to-end job workflows from mobile devices while enabling customers to approve, communicate, and prepare for service completion in real time.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Technician Job Execution
- **Step Management:** Allow technicians to start/pause/complete steps, capture torque readings, and upload annotated media.
- **Parts & Labor Logging:** Provide barcode/QR scanning to consume parts, auto-syncing with inventory reservations.
- **Time Tracking:** Implement per-step timers and automatic labor logging with overtime thresholds.
- **Why:** Ensures field execution data is captured accurately without returning to a desktop terminal.

### 2. Customer Engagement Flows
- **Live Status:** Stream job progress, estimated completion time, and cost updates to the customer app.
- **Approvals:** Enable one-tap approval/decline for recommended upsell services with digital signatures.
- **Payments Prep:** Allow customers to preload payment method, review invoices, and request financing options.
- **Why:** Keeps customers informed, reduces phone calls, and accelerates payment readiness.

### 3. Real-Time Collaboration
- **In-App Chat:** Provide secure messaging between customers, technicians, and service advisors with quick templates.
- **Escalations:** Add workflow for supervisors to join conversations, tag teammates, and hand off context.
- **Notifications:** Sync chat and approval events to push notifications and inbox badges.
- **Why:** Breaks down communication silos and resolves issues quickly during service.

### 4. Device Capability Integrations
- **Camera & Media:** Support multi-image uploads, video snippets, and markup tools with compression pipelines.
- **Geolocation:** Capture technician arrival/departure timestamps for SLA tracking and automate check-ins.
- **Hardware Integrations:** Prepare BLE interface hooks for torque wrenches or diagnostic sensors (mock initially).
- **Why:** Leverages mobile hardware to enhance service quality and accountability.
