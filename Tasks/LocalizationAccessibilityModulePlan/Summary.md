# 🌍 Localization & Accessibility Platform — Delivery Plan

## 🎯 Module Vision
Deliver a shared localization and accessibility platform that ensures every garage, customer, and operator experience works seamlessly in Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR), complies with WCAG 2.1 AA, and scales across new markets without retrofits. The module centralizes translations, layouts, currencies, and inclusive design guardrails so that product teams can ship features faster with confidence.

## 🧭 Sprint Roadmap Overview
| Sprint | Theme | Highlights |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Sprint 1 | Foundation & Frameworks | Establish localization services, translation memory, RTL-ready component library, and accessibility linting pipelines. |
| Sprint 2 | Workflow & Experience Depth | Roll out translation management UI, automated accessibility testing, bilingual content governance, and printable artifact support. |
| Sprint 3 | Intelligence & Compliance | Layer translation quality scoring, adaptive UX controls, AI-assisted copy suggestions, and recurring accessibility audits across channels. |

## 🔗 Cross-Cutting Considerations
- **Platform Coverage:** Web admin, technician app, customer app, notifications, PDFs, and exported reports must consume the same localization catalogs and directionality rules.
- **Performance:** Translation lookups must be cached and fail-safe; fallbacks default to English with clear audit logs of missing keys.
- **Governance:** Track translation ownership, review status, and accessibility waivers per module with audit trails for regulators.
- **Toolchain:** Integrate with design systems (Figma tokens), CI pipelines (linting/tests), and documentation portals to keep content in sync.
- **Regionalization:** Support GCC currency/number/date formats, prayer-time aware scheduling hints, and Hijri/Gregorian toggles where mandated.

## 📈 Effort & Resourcing
- Estimated **14–16 engineering weeks** across frontend foundations, platform services, automation, and compliance enablement.
- Requires a **Localization PM**, **Accessibility SME**, **Platform engineer**, **Frontend/Design system engineer**, and **QA automation** support.
- Engage **Arabic linguists** and **WCAG auditors** during Sprint 2 & 3 to certify translations and inclusive design practices.

## ✅ Expected Outcomes
- All user-facing surfaces honor RTL/LTR layouts, localized content, and accessible interactions by default.
- Product squads inherit reusable tooling (components, scripts, test suites) that reduce localization debt and accessibility regressions.
- The platform generates continuous insights—coverage, quality scores, outstanding issues—so leadership can track readiness for new market launches.

## 🔄 Dependencies & Alignment
- Requires **Design System revamp** to adopt bidirectional tokens and semantic colors with sufficient contrast.
- Leverages **Notification & Communication module** for template localization hooks and translation placeholders.
- Coordinates with **Reports & Dashboards** to ensure chart libraries and exports support bilingual labels and screen-reader metadata.
- Works closely with **Mobile Apps Integration** to ship updated SDKs, string bundles, and accessibility gesture patterns.

## 🚀 Rollout Strategy
1. Launch internal enablement sessions after Sprint 1 to onboard squads to new components, string extraction, and linting requirements.
2. Use two pilot modules (e.g., **Customer Management** and **Appointments & Scheduling**) in Sprint 2 to validate translation workflows end-to-end before scaling.
3. Introduce compliance dashboards in Sprint 3 that feed into Super Admin governance for cross-tenant visibility and regulator reporting.

## 📚 Success Metrics
- ≥95% translation coverage for production routes with <0.5% missing key rate in telemetry.
- WCAG automated checks pass rate ≥ 98% with zero critical accessibility defects during regression.
- Reduction of localization-related bugs by 60% compared to pre-platform baseline.
- Time-to-market for new locale launch reduced from ~6 weeks to <2 weeks after Sprint 3 enablement.
