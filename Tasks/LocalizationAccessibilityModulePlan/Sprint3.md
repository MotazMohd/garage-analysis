# üöÄ Sprint 3: Intelligence & Compliance

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Elevate the localization and accessibility platform with automation, governance dashboards, and predictive insights that sustain quality across future market launches.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Translation Quality Intelligence
- **Scoring Engine:** Implement quality scoring using linguist ratings, telemetry (user locale errors), and MT post-edit distance.
- **AI Assistance:** Introduce AI-assisted copy suggestions for untranslated strings with human-in-the-loop review and bias guardrails.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Capture in-product feedback widgets allowing users to flag translation issues tied to specific keys.
- **Why:** Provides data-driven insights into translation health and accelerates content updates.

### 2. Adaptive UX Controls
- **Dynamic Layout Adjustments:** Automatically adjust typography, spacing, and component density based on language length heuristics.
- **Accessibility Preferences:** Allow users to opt into high-contrast, text-to-speech, larger font modes stored per profile/tenant.
- **Performance Optimization:** Preload locale bundles intelligently and lazy-load heavy assets to maintain performance parity.
- **Why:** Keeps experiences polished as languages and accessibility needs expand.

### 3. Compliance Dashboards & Audit Trails
- **Dashboards:** Build Super Admin dashboards summarizing localization coverage, accessibility status, outstanding waivers, and remediation SLAs per tenant/module.
- **Exportable Reports:** Generate regulator-ready reports (PDF/CSV) with proof of compliance, audit logs, and upcoming review dates.
- **Policy Engine:** Manage waivers/exception requests with expiration reminders and automated escalation.
- **Why:** Ensures ongoing compliance and simplifies audits across regions.

### 4. Extended Channel Coverage
- **Reports & BI:** Ensure charts, pivot tables, and exports support bilingual labels, screen-reader metadata, and accessible color palettes.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Provide SDK/CLI for partners (insurance APIs, supplier portals) to fetch translations and adhere to accessibility guidelines.
- **Offline & Kiosk Modes:** Package localized assets for offline technician apps or kiosks with synchronization workflows.
- **Why:** Extends platform guarantees beyond core web/mobile into data and partner ecosystems.

### 5. Continuous Improvement Programs
- **Localization OKRs:** Define key metrics and scorecards tracked quarterly with leadership reviews.
- **A11y Bug Bashes:** Schedule recurring inclusive testing sessions with customers, technicians, and assistive tech specialists.
- **Runbooks & Playbooks:** Finalize operational runbooks for release managers covering localization freeze windows and compliance sign-off steps.
- **Why:** Institutionalizes localization & accessibility as ongoing programs, not one-off projects.

## üìå Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Translation quality scoring and AI-assisted suggestions active with human review logs and opt-out controls.
- [ ] Adaptive UX features (contrast modes, dynamic layouts) available in admin, technician, and customer surfaces with persistence per user.
- [ ] Compliance dashboards and exportable reports provide real-time localization/a11y status per tenant/module.
- [ ] Reports, BI exports, and partner SDKs consume shared localization assets and meet accessibility guidelines.
- [ ] Continuous improvement programs operational with documented runbooks, scheduled audits, and leadership reporting.

## üîó Dependencies & Risks
- **Dependencies:** Data warehouse for telemetry feeds, AI platform access for suggestion models, Super Admin governance dashboards, Partner integration frameworks.
- **Risks:** AI suggestion accuracy, regulatory expectations evolving per country, maintenance overhead for adaptive UX features across devices.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Effort
| Area | Time |
|------|------|
| Quality intelligence & AI assistance | 1.5 weeks |
| Adaptive UX & preference management | 1.3 weeks |
| Compliance dashboards & reporting | 1.2 weeks |
| Extended channel coverage | 1.1 weeks |
| Continuous improvement programs | 0.7 weeks |

**Total:** ~5.8 weeks (requires collaboration with data, AI/ML, and compliance teams)

## ‚úÖ Sprint Outcome
- Localization & accessibility become measurable, governed programs with transparent dashboards and automation.
- Users experience adaptive, performant interfaces that respect their language and accessibility preferences.
- The platform is ready for additional locales and regulatory reviews without major engineering spikes.
