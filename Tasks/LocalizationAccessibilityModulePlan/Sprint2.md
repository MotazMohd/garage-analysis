# üöÄ Sprint 2: Workflow & Experience Depth

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Operationalize translation and accessibility workflows across squads, covering content authoring, review loops, and high-impact user journeys (web, mobile, notifications, PDFs).

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Translation Management Workspace
- **UI:** Build translator/reviewer workspace with string search, status filters, inline previews (web + mobile), and bulk actions.
- **Workflow:** Support draft ‚Üí in review ‚Üí approved states with role-based permissions (translator, reviewer, localization PM).
- **Integrations:** Hook into Slack/Teams for review notifications and integrate with glossary/terminology management.
- **Why:** Enables linguists and product owners to manage bilingual copy without engineering intervention.

### 2. Content Extraction & Sync Automation
- **String Extraction:** Add CLI scripts/Git hooks to extract new strings from codebases (React, .NET backend messages, mobile apps).
- **Sync Jobs:** Schedule nightly jobs to sync translation catalogs to CDN/object storage and mobile bundle updates.
- **Missing Key Resolution:** Auto-create translation tasks when missing keys detected in telemetry with context metadata.
- **Why:** Keeps catalogs fresh and reduces manual copy/paste workflows.

### 3. Inclusive Experience Enhancements
- **Forms & Tables:** Ensure form controls, tables, and dashboards adapt to RTL with logical focus order and screen-reader labels.
- **Media & Attachments:** Provide captioning/alt-text enforcement for uploaded media, including bulk import validations.
- **Notifications & PDFs:** Update template editor to support bilingual bodies, dynamic placeholders, and accessible PDFs (tagged structure, reading order).
- **Why:** Delivers consistent, inclusive experiences across high-traffic surfaces.

### 4. Automated Accessibility Regression Suite
- **Visual Regression:** Integrate Percy/Chromatic with RTL snapshots to catch layout issues introduced by translations.
- **Mobile Testing:** Add Appium/XCUITest/espresso flows covering voice-over/talkback navigation for critical technician & customer journeys.
- **Reporting:** Publish dashboards summarizing violations by module, severity, and trend, with Jira integration for follow-up.
- **Why:** Scales accessibility coverage beyond manual audits.

### 5. Training & Enablement
- **Playbooks:** Publish localization & accessibility playbooks covering best practices, glossary usage, and translation-ready design tips.
- **Workshops:** Run workshops with squads (Customer Management, Appointments) to adopt new tooling and close backlog violations.
- **Certification:** Introduce certification checklist for squads to mark modules as "Localization Ready" and "Accessibility Ready".
- **Why:** Ensures adoption beyond platform teams and creates shared accountability.

## üìå Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Translation management workspace supports end-to-end workflows with auditing and notifications.
- [ ] Automated string extraction and nightly sync jobs keep catalogs up to date across web/mobile/notification channels.
- [ ] Core user journeys (booking, job tracking, invoicing) verified for bilingual content, RTL layout, and accessible interaction patterns.
- [ ] Automated regression suite (web + mobile) runs in CI with actionable reporting and defect triage integration.
- [ ] Squads complete enablement sessions; at least two pilot modules achieve "Localization Ready" certification.

## üîó Dependencies & Risks
- **Dependencies:** Notification templates, PDF generation service, Mobile app build pipelines, QA device lab for assistive tech testing.
- **Risks:** Translator capacity constraints, variance in terminology across markets, potential CI slowdowns due to visual regression coverage.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Effort
| Area | Time |
|------|------|
| Translation workspace & workflow engine | 1.4 weeks |
| Extraction & sync automation | 1.0 week |
| Inclusive UX enhancements | 1.5 weeks |
| Accessibility regression suite | 1.1 weeks |
| Training & enablement | 0.6 weeks |

**Total:** ~5.6 weeks (with shared support from design, QA, and content teams)

---

## ‚úÖ Sprint Outcome
- Linguists and PMs manage translations autonomously with full traceability.
- High-value journeys across web, mobile, notifications, and PDFs meet bilingual and accessibility requirements.
- Automated guardrails catch regressions early, enabling squads to scale localization without bottlenecks.
