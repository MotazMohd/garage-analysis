# 🛡️ Super Admin & Tenant Governance Overview

## 🌟 Vision
Empower SaaS operators with a single control plane to onboard garages, manage subscriptions and marketplace add-ons, and enforce compliance guardrails while giving customer success and finance teams full visibility into tenant health.

---

## 🧩 Sprint Breakdown
- **Sprint 1 – Tenant Lifecycle Foundations:** Deliver end-to-end onboarding, verification, and subscription tooling so Super Admins can confidently activate and manage garages across regions.
- **Sprint 2 – Marketplace & Feature Controls:** Enable modular feature packaging, add-on marketplace management, and health dashboards so plans can be tailored without engineering interventions.
- **Sprint 3 – Compliance, Insights & Automation:** Layer data governance, impersonation oversight, revenue analytics, and automated interventions to keep the network compliant and high-performing at scale.

---

## 🔄 Cross-Cutting Considerations
- **Security & Access Control:** Restrict Super Admin actions with fine-grained permissions, MFA enforcement, and delegated roles for finance or customer success teams.
- **Localization & Multi-Currency:** Support bilingual UI copy, RTL layouts, and currency conversion for pricing, invoices, and revenue dashboards across covered countries.
- **Auditability & Data Retention:** Ensure every tenant change, impersonation, and plan adjustment is logged with before/after snapshots that meet regulatory audit requirements.
- **Integration Readiness:** Expose webhook/API hooks for CRM, billing, and support systems to keep external tooling in sync with tenant lifecycle events.
- **Operational Observability:** Provide metrics, alerts, and activity feeds so internal teams can react quickly to tenant escalations or system regressions.

## 📏 Total Estimated Effort
| Sprint | Effort |
|--------|--------|
| Sprint 1 | ~6 dev days |
| Sprint 2 | ~6.5 dev days |
| Sprint 3 | ~6.5 dev days |

**Aggregate:** ~19 dev days (excludes commercial/legal contract review time).

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- Garages experience a consistent, auditable activation journey with clear plan assignments, billing status, and support contacts.
- SaaS leadership can package modules, monitor usage, and adjust entitlements without needing ad-hoc engineering involvement.
- Compliance, finance, and customer success teams operate from a shared source of truth with alerts and automation that reduce churn and regulatory risk.
