# üì¶ Sprint 2: Marketplace & Feature Controls

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Equip Super Admins with modular packaging, add-on marketplace management, and real-time health insights so plans can be tuned quickly while monitoring tenant adoption.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Feature Catalog & Bundling Engine
- **Metadata:** Model features/modules with prerequisites, availability by plan, and required integrations.
- **Bundling:** Allow creation of custom bundles and temporary promotions with validity windows.
- **Why:** Provides flexibility to tailor offerings per region or segment without engineering releases.

### 2. Add-on Marketplace Management
- **Listings:** Create marketplace UI/API for optional add-ons (insurance API, analytics pack, integrations).
- **Lifecycle:** Support request ‚Üí approval ‚Üí provisioning flow with SLA tracking and automated notifications.
- **Why:** Enables incremental revenue and partner offerings controlled centrally.

### 3. Usage & Health Dashboards
- **Metrics:** Surface tenant-level KPIs (active users, appointments, invoices, storage usage) with thresholds per plan.
- **Visuals:** Build charts/cards with filters (plan, country, age) and export capabilities for finance/CS teams.
- **Why:** Gives operators insight into adoption, upsell targets, and churn risk.

### 4. Entitlement Enforcement & Sync
- **API:** Expose entitlement service consumed by product modules to check if features are enabled.
- **Sync:** Propagate entitlement changes to feature flag service and tenant configuration caches with audit logs.
- **Why:** Prevents unauthorized access to premium features and reduces manual toggles.

### 5. Internal Workflows & Collaboration Hooks
- **Tasks:** Auto-create follow-up tasks/tickets (e.g., via Jira/ServiceNow webhook) when upsell requests or health alerts fire.
- **Notifications:** Integrate with Notification platform for internal alerts to finance/CS Slack/Email channels.
- **Why:** Ensures add-on and health workflows involve the right teams promptly.

## üìå Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feature catalog supports reusable definitions, plan mapping, and time-bound promotions editable in the console.
- [ ] Marketplace lists add-ons with status tracking, approvals, provisioning steps, and automated messaging.
- [ ] Health dashboard visualizes core KPIs with filters and exports; thresholds trigger alerts for at-risk tenants.
- [ ] Entitlement API returns accurate plan/feature state and propagates changes to feature flag service with audit trails.
- [ ] Upsell approvals and health alerts create downstream tasks/notifications for assigned internal teams.

## üîó Dependencies & Risks
- **Dependencies:** Feature flag service, analytics warehouse/ETL for usage metrics, Notification module for alerting, Task management integrations.
- **Risks:** Data latency causing stale metrics, complex promotion edge cases, and ensuring entitlements sync atomically across services.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Effort
| Area | Time |
|------|------|
| Feature catalog & bundling | 1.4 days |
| Marketplace workflows | 1.5 days |
| Usage dashboards | 1.4 days |
| Entitlement service & sync | 1.3 days |
| Internal workflow hooks | 0.9 days |
