# ðŸš€ Purchase Orders & Supplier Integration â€“ Sprint 3 Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal
Deliver intelligent procurement optimizations, ecosystem integrations, and governance tooling to scale purchasing across mul
tiple branches and supplier networks.

## ðŸ“¦ Scope & Deliverables
- **Predictive Procurement Intelligence**
  - Build forecasting models that recommend reorder quantities/timing using consumption history, lead times, and seasonality.
  - Surface supplier risk scores (quality, delays, pricing volatility) with prescriptive mitigation actions.
  - Provide scenario planning tools to simulate demand spikes or supplier outages.
- **Ecosystem Integrations**
  - Connect to external supplier ERPs via EDI/API for automated PO transmission and status updates.
  - Integrate digital payment providers to process deposits or advance payments upon shipment confirmation.
  - Enable direct drop-ship workflows where suppliers fulfill to customer locations while maintaining audit traceability.
- **Global Compliance & Governance**
  - Enforce regional tax/regulatory rules (GST/VAT, customs documentation) during PO creation and receiving.
  - Add contract management features to track supplier agreements, renewal dates, and compliance attestations.
  - Implement procurement policy dashboards with KPIs (spend under contract, policy exceptions, carbon impact).
- **Change Management & Enablement**
  - Produce training modules, sandbox environments, and rollout playbooks for procurement and finance teams.
  - Establish monitoring/alerting for integration failures, SLA breaches, and forecasting anomalies.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- Forecasting and risk insights are embedded within the PO creation flow and generate actionable recommendations.
- External supplier integrations support automated PO exchange with acknowledgment sync in under 5 minutes.
- Compliance checks prevent submission of POs that violate regional policies or contract thresholds.
- Enablement materials and observability dashboards are published and adopted by pilot branches.

## ðŸ“Š Effort & Resourcing
- **Estimated Effort:** ~10 dev days.
- **Team:** 1 product manager, 2 full-stack engineers, 1 data engineer, 1 ML engineer, 1 integrations engineer, 1 QA.
- **Dependencies:** Data platform forecasts, integration middleware, compliance/legal guidelines.
