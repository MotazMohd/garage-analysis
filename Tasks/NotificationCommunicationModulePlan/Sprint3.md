## üéØ Sprint Goal
Introduce analytics, experimentation, compliance automation, and self-service tooling so communication programs can be optimized while staying audit-ready.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Delivery Analytics & Reporting
- **Warehouse Pipelines:** Stream notification events into analytics warehouse with channel, template, and engagement metrics.
- **Dashboards:** Build dashboards for delivery rates, open/click, response latency, and provider health segmented per tenant.
- **Alerts:** Add anomaly detection for sudden drops or spikes and wire alerts to operations.
- **Why:** Provides visibility to tune messaging effectiveness and provider contracts.

### 2. Experimentation & Segmentation Framework
- **A/B Testing:** Enable template/version experiments with randomization and statistical significance tracking.
- **Segmentation:** Allow targeting by customer tier, technician role, language preference, and engagement history.
- **APIs:** Expose experiment status to consuming services for consistent reporting.
- **Why:** Drives continuous improvement and personalization without custom code releases.

### 3. Compliance, Retention, and Legal Holds
- **Retention Policies:** Implement configurable message retention and redaction schedules per channel and country.
- **Legal Holds:** Allow SaaS/legal teams to pause deletion for investigations and log actions.
- **Export:** Provide secure export of notification history with masking and watermarking.
- **Why:** Meets regulatory requirements and supports dispute resolution.

### 4. Campaign Builder & Self-Service Automation
- **UI:** Deliver wizard for scheduling multi-step campaigns (e.g., service reminders) using predefined templates and segments.
- **Approval Workflow:** Support draft ‚Üí review ‚Üí publish lifecycle with role-based approvals and audit logs.
- **Rate Control:** Include per-campaign rate limiting and budget guardrails.
- **Why:** Empowers business teams to iterate without engineering tickets.

### 5. Operational Guardrails & Reliability Enhancements
- **SLAs:** Track per-tenant SLAs and escalate to provider switch when breached.
- **Auto Failover:** Implement automated failover to secondary providers for email/SMS during outages.
- **Runbooks:** Document incident response playbooks with runbook links in observability dashboards.
- **Why:** Ensures platform remains resilient as volume scales.
