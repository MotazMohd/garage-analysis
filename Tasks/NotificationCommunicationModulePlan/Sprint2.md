# ‚öôÔ∏è Sprint 2: Orchestration & Automations

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Expand the notification platform with workflow orchestration, scheduling, and mobile push so time-sensitive communications execute reliably across preferred channels.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Event Router & Workflow Engine
- **Capabilities:** Build rules engine to map incoming events to channel sequences, fallback chains, and throttling limits.
- **Configuration:** Allow tenant admins to define business rules (e.g., resend SMS if email unopened within 2 hours).
- **Why:** Ensures context-appropriate messaging without manual code changes.

### 2. Push Notification Integration
- **Providers:** Integrate with Firebase/Apple push services via mobile platform team.
- **Payloads:** Support deep links to appointments, job cards, approvals, and in-app inbox.
- **Device Registry:** Store device tokens keyed by user with rotation and revocation flows.
- **Why:** Completes omni-channel reach, especially for technician and customer apps.

### 3. Scheduling, Digest, and Quiet Hours
- **Scheduler:** Enable delayed send, recurring reminders, and campaign windows.
- **Digesting:** Aggregate low-priority events into configurable digests per channel.
- **Quiet Hours:** Enforce tenant/user quiet hours by channel with override for critical alerts.
- **Why:** Prevents message fatigue and aligns with regional regulations.

### 4. Fallback & Failure Handling Enhancements
- **Smart Retries:** Escalate to alternate channels or contacts when primary fails or remains unacknowledged.
- **Idempotency:** Ensure duplicate prevention using event hashes and request IDs.
- **Dead Letter Queues:** Route irrecoverable events for manual review with tooling.
- **Why:** Maintains reliability even during provider outages.

### 5. Preference Center Enhancements & Self-Service APIs
- **Granularity:** Allow users to opt into topics (appointments, invoices, marketing) and update contact info.
- **Self-Service APIs:** Provide GraphQL/REST endpoints for other modules to query preferences and register notification topics.
- **Audit:** Track preference change history for compliance.
- **Why:** Reduces support load and aligns with privacy requirements.

## üìå Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Routing engine applies tenant-configured workflows with throttling, retries, and channel fallbacks.
- [ ] Push notifications reach registered devices with localization, deep links, and token lifecycle management.
- [ ] Scheduler honors delayed sends, digest windows, and quiet hours for both SMS and email.
- [ ] Dead letter queues capture failed events with alerting, and idempotency prevents duplicate sends.
- [ ] Preference center supports topic-level controls, exposes APIs, and logs all changes with user attribution.

## üîó Dependencies & Risks
- **Dependencies:** Mobile apps integration for handling push payloads, Analytics warehouse for engagement metrics, Feature flag service for staged rollout.
- **Risks:** Managing complex routing rules without impacting latency, ensuring digest scheduling respects multi-timezone tenants, and securing device token storage.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Effort
| Area | Time |
|------|------|
| Workflow engine & routing rules | 1.5 days |
| Push integration & device registry | 1.2 days |
| Scheduling, digests, quiet hours | 1.0 days |
| Fallback handling & DLQ tooling | 0.9 days |
| Preference center enhancements & APIs | 0.9 days |

**Total:** ~5.5 dev days

## ‚úÖ Sprint Outcome
- Notification workflows adapt to tenant rules, providing timely escalations and reduced noise.
- Mobile push joins email and SMS, delivering actionable updates directly to technician and customer apps.
- Support teams gain tooling to manage failed events and preference updates without engineering intervention.
