# 📣 Notification & Communication Module Overview

## 🌟 Vision
Deliver reliable, localized, and compliant communications across email, SMS, push, and in-app channels so garages, technicians, and customers receive the right signal at the right time with full traceability.

---

## 🧩 Sprint Breakdown
- **Sprint 1 – Messaging Foundations:** Stand up the notification domain models, provider integrations, preference center, and templating infrastructure required for multi-channel delivery.
- **Sprint 2 – Orchestration & Automations:** Orchestrate event-driven workflows, fallback strategies, scheduling, and mobile push so communications remain timely and contextual.
- **Sprint 3 – Intelligence & Governance:** Layer analytics, experimentation, compliance controls, and self-service tooling to optimize communication quality while meeting regulatory guardrails.

## 🔄 Cross-Cutting Considerations
- **Localization & Personalization:** All templates and preference pages must support bilingual (Arabic/English) content, RTL layouts, and variable substitution for garage branding.
- **Compliance & Consent:** Capture explicit opt-in/out per channel, store delivery receipts for audit, and honor regional anti-spam, data retention, and DND regulations.
- **Scalability & Reliability:** Abstract providers behind retryable queues with exponential backoff, circuit breaking, and health monitoring to maintain delivery SLAs.
- **Security & Privacy:** Mask PII in logs, encrypt stored messages where required, and restrict sensitive template editing to authorized roles with audit trails.
- **Observability & Supportability:** Provide dashboards, alerting, and searchable delivery logs so operators can troubleshoot failed notifications quickly.

## 📏 Total Estimated Effort
| Sprint | Effort |
|--------|--------|
| Sprint 1 | ~5 dev days |
| Sprint 2 | ~5.5 dev days |
| Sprint 3 | ~6 dev days |

**Aggregate:** ~16.5 dev days (excludes provider contract negotiations and legal review).

---

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- Communication events become consistent, auditable, and configurable for every garage tenant, reducing manual follow-up and missed SLAs.
- Customers and technicians receive timely updates on appointments, job progress, approvals, and payments across their preferred channels.
- Product and operations teams gain insight and controls to iterate on messaging quality while staying compliant with regional regulations.
