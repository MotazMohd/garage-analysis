# üß© Spare Parts & Inventory Module ‚Äî Delivery Plan

## üéØ Epic Objective
Give garages and the SaaS operator a single, governed catalogue for parts, inventory positions, and pricing so technicians always know what is available, finance trusts the valuation, and services can confidently reserve what they need.

---

## üöÄ Sprint 1: Catalogue & Inventory Foundations
- Stand up the Spare Part master data with taxonomy, compatibility, and visibility flags for global vs. garage-specific items.
- Provide garage-level inventory records with stock, pricing, and threshold metadata plus CRUD surfaces across web and APIs.
- Deliver Excel import/export, validation rules, and activity logging so migration from legacy trackers is safe and auditable.

## üîÑ Sprint 2: Procurement & Usage Operations
- Wire supplier references, purchase orders, and cost tracking to each stock entry to support replenishment workflows.
- Link parts to services, job cards, and tool recommendations to power technician guidance and reservation of critical items.
- Introduce low-stock alerts, approval checkpoints, and multi-branch allocations so managers can control consumption.

## ü§ñ Sprint 3: Intelligence & Collaboration
- Launch predictive demand modeling, historical usage analytics, and profitability dashboards for parts leadership.
- Enable inter-garage sharing, catalog publishing controls, and programmable APIs for ecosystem integrations.
- Automate audits, compliance exports, and experimentation hooks to iterate on stocking strategy safely.

## üìã Cross-Cutting Considerations
| Topic | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Data Governance** | Align part IDs, taxonomy, and visibility with service templates, supplier catalogs, and audit policies. |
| **Localization** | Support bilingual labels, multi-currency pricing, and unit conversions per market. |
| **Security & Access** | Enforce role-based editing versus viewing, especially for pricing and cross-garage visibility. |
| **Performance** | Index search/filter attributes (category, vehicle, tags) and batch pagination for large catalogs. |
| **Change Management** | Provide migration playbooks, validation dashboards, and feature toggles for phased activation. |

## ‚è±Ô∏è Total Estimated Effort
| Sprint | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Sprint 1 | ~9 dev days |
| Sprint 2 | ~9.5 dev days |
| Sprint 3 | ~10 dev days |

**Overall:** ~28.5 dev days across the first three sprints.
