# ü§ñ Sprint 3: Intelligence, Collaboration & Compliance

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Leverage accumulated data to predict demand, unlock inter-garage collaboration, and embed compliance automation that keeps parts operations resilient at scale.

---

## üì¶ Scope & Deliverables
1. **Predictive Insights & Experimentation**
   - Train demand forecasting models using historical usage, seasonality, and booking pipeline signals.
   - Deliver dashboards for forecast vs. actuals, profitability per part, and recommended reorder quantities.
   - Introduce experimentation hooks (A/B price tests, reorder threshold experiments) with guardrails.
2. **Inter-Garage Collaboration APIs**
   - Enable catalog publishing controls for garages opting into sharing parts with partners.
   - Provide marketplace-style search (`GET /api/partner-parts`) with availability, pricing, and SLA metadata.
   - Support reservation requests, approval flows, and transfer logging between garages.
3. **Compliance & Audit Automation**
   - Generate scheduled compliance exports (stock valuation, serialized part movement, warranty status) with secure delivery.
   - Implement anomaly detection on adjustments and approvals to flag suspicious activity.
   - Enhance audit trails with tamper-proof event storage and retention policies.
4. **Performance & Reliability Hardening**
   - Add background jobs for forecast recalculation, alert deduplication, and stale reservation cleanup.
   - Optimize search indices and caching strategies for large cross-garage catalogs.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Forecast dashboards surface recommended reorder quantities with accuracy benchmarks and audit logs.
- [ ] Partner garages can publish, discover, and request shared parts with approval visibility for both parties.
- [ ] Scheduled compliance exports run automatically and are retrievable with retention/permissions applied.
- [ ] Anomaly detection alerts operations when unusual adjustments or approvals occur.
- [ ] Background jobs keep forecasts, reservations, and caches current without manual intervention.

## üîó Dependencies & Alignment
- Data platform/warehouse for historical usage feeds and ML experimentation.
- Garage collaboration policies defined by business/legal stakeholders.
- Observability stack for tracking job success and anomaly alerts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Forecast models lack sufficient historical data. | Start with rule-based heuristics and upgrade to ML as data accrues. |
| Cross-garage sharing raises contractual concerns. | Implement feature flags and per-part visibility scopes agreed with legal. |
| Compliance exports expose sensitive pricing. | Encrypt exports, apply least-privilege download permissions, and log access. |

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Effort
| Area | Time |
|------|------|
| Data science & analytics surfaces | 4 days |
| Collaboration APIs & workflows | 3.5 days |
| Compliance automation & hardening | 2 days |
| QA & launch readiness | 0.5 day |

**Total:** ~10 dev days.
