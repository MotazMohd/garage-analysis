# üìä Sprint 3: Optimization & Automation

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Introduce automation, analytics, and cross-team coordination features that maximize technician utilization, reduce turnaround times, and continuously improve service delivery.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Workload Balancing Engine
- **Scheduler:** Build algorithm to recommend technician assignments based on skills, availability, workload, and SLA priority.
- **What-if Analysis:** Allow supervisors to simulate assignment changes before committing.
- **Integration:** Surface recommendations in assignment board with confidence scores.
- **Why:** Improves throughput and ensures high-priority jobs receive the right resources.

### 2. Automated Escalations & SLA Tracking
- **SLA Definitions:** Configure SLA templates tied to service types (e.g., oil change vs. engine rebuild).
- **Monitoring:** Background job monitors elapsed time and triggers escalations for nearing/ breached SLAs.
- **Actions:** Auto-assign floater technicians or notify service managers when intervention is required.
- **Why:** Keeps commitments visible and minimizes delays for critical work.

### 3. Parts & Tool Coordination
- **Dependencies:** Display required spare parts/tool reservations alongside each job task with availability status.
- **Alerts:** Notify inventory managers when parts shortages threaten task start.
- **Automation:** Optionally auto-create spare parts pick lists and tool reservations when jobs are scheduled.
- **Why:** Synchronizes execution with material readiness, preventing idle time.

### 4. Insights & Continuous Improvement
- **Dashboards:** Add metrics for technician utilization, job cycle time, rework rates, and SLA compliance.
- **Drill-down:** Allow supervisors to review root-cause notes for delayed or reworked tasks.
- **Feedback Loop:** Capture technician feedback post-job to iterate on service templates.
- **Why:** Provides data-driven feedback to improve operations and training.

### 5. Change Management & Rollout
- **Training:** Develop scenario-based training for supervisors on the new automation capabilities.
- **Playbooks:** Document recommended actions for escalation alerts and workload adjustments.
- **Pilot:** Run controlled rollout in one flagship garage before full deployment.
- **Why:** Ensures adoption and builds trust in automation outputs.
