# 🗂️ Job Cards & Task Assignment — Delivery Plan

## 🎯 Epic Objective
Transform approved service plans into executable job cards with smart assignment, real-time collaboration, and optimization tools that keep technician teams efficient and customers informed.

---

## 🚀 Sprint 1: Job Card Foundations
- Model core entities (`JobCard`, `JobTask`, `JobAssignment`, `JobCardNote`) with status history.
- Generate job cards from service orders and assign technicians with skill validation.
- Track status changes and notes through API-driven workflows and supervisor UI.
- **Outcome:** Garages can reliably create actionable job cards and manage responsibility for each task.

## 🔧 Sprint 2: Execution Visibility & Collaboration
- Provide technician task boards with timers, media uploads, and live updates for supervisors.
- Implement labor tracking, milestone notifications, and integrated quality checklists.
- **Outcome:** Operations teams collaborate in real time while customers receive transparent status updates.

## 📊 Sprint 3: Optimization & Automation
- Recommend assignments with workload balancing, monitor SLAs, and coordinate parts/tool readiness.
- Deliver analytics dashboards and rollout support for continuous improvement.
- **Outcome:** Intelligent automation reduces turnaround times and ensures resources are prepared before work begins.

## 📋 Cross-Cutting Considerations
| Topic | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Security & Roles** | Supervisors manage assignments; technicians edit only their tasks; customers view limited status. |
| **Audit & Compliance** | Persist all status changes, time logs, media, and checklist results for regulatory needs. |
| **Integration Points** | Sync with Spare Parts, Tool Management, and Scheduling modules for end-to-end orchestration. |
| **Performance** | Use paginated job lists with filters by garage, technician, SLA status, and completion percentage. |
| **Offline Support** | Mobile technician app caches task details to support low-connectivity workshops. |

## ⏱️ Total Estimated Effort
| Sprint | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Sprint 1 | ~5 dev days |
| Sprint 2 | ~5.5 dev days |
| Sprint 3 | ~6.5 dev days |

**Overall:** ~17 dev days across the three sprints.
