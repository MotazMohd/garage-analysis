# üõ†Ô∏è Service Template & Execution Module ‚Äî Delivery Plan

## üéØ Module Vision
Establish a flexible service catalog that mirrors how garages plan and execute work, from admin configuration through customer booking. The module must support structured metadata, technician and tool readiness, upsell guidance, and guardrails that keep the booking and execution journey consistent across branches.

## üó∫Ô∏è Sprint Roadmap Overview
| Sprint | Theme | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Data foundations & refactor | Replace hardcoded enums with lookup tables, introduce service categories, enrich service‚Äìpart rules, migrate legacy records, and seed defaults. |
| 2 | Operational intelligence | Layer in technician skill tags, tool dependencies, pre-check flows, and recommended parts with full API/UI coverage. |
| 3 | Customer-facing experience | Expose visibility and booking rules, deliver rich selection UX, and ensure services surface correctly across channels. |

## üåê Cross-Cutting Considerations
- **Backward compatibility:** data migrations must assign safe defaults so legacy jobs and historical reporting remain intact.
- **Tenant isolation:** lookup management is SaaS-owned; garage admins consume read-only values while still receiving localized labels via feature flags.
- **Performance:** catalogue endpoints feed booking flows‚Äîadd pagination, caching hints, and index coverage on lookup keys to keep mobile apps responsive.
- **Auditability:** changes to service structure influence pricing and compliance; record who altered service flags, recommended parts, and pre-check rules.
- **Documentation & enablement:** provide admin help content and developer field guides to explain when to mark services as add-ons, approval-required, or hidden.

## ü§ù Dependencies & Integrations
- Relies on **Spare Parts & Inventory** for part metadata, cost calculations, and availability checks.
- Shares skill taxonomy with **Technician Training & Certification** to avoid duplicate tagging.
- Consumes tool catalogue from **Tool Management** to validate readiness before booking.
- Feeds booking logic within **Appointments & Scheduling** and job creation flows in **Job Cards & Task Assignment**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
- **Migration mistakes** could hide services or break pricing ‚Üí run dry-runs in staging with anonymized tenant data and provide rollback scripts.
- **Lookup drift** between environments ‚Üí ship seed scripts as idempotent migrations and enforce checksum alerts in CI.
- **UX overload** in admin forms ‚Üí phase rollout with contextual tips and sensible defaults so garages are not overwhelmed when configuring services.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Effort & Resourcing
| Sprint | Est. Dev Days | Primary Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 9 | Backend engineer, frontend engineer, QA |
| 2 | 7 | Backend engineer, frontend engineer |
| 3 | 8 | Frontend engineer, product designer, QA |

Delivering all three sprints readies the platform for downstream automation such as dynamic job sequencing, personalized upsell journeys, and predictive maintenance packages.
