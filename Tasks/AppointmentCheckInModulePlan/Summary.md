# üõ¨ Appointment Check-in Module ‚Äî Delivery Plan

## üéØ Epic Objective
Streamline the arrival-to-intake experience so reception teams can admit vehicles quickly, capture mandatory evidence, and prime downstream job execution with accurate, actionable data.

---

## üöÄ Sprint 1: Intake Foundations
- Deliver the core check-in workflow that transitions appointments to "Arrived" status and hands off to job card creation.
- Enforce mandatory photo capture, optional condition logging, and automatic intake document generation.
- Broadcast arrival events and customer notifications to keep stakeholders aligned in real time.

## üîÑ Sprint 2: Operational Controls & Upsell Enablement
- Add configurable policies for condition capture, add-on suggestions, and rejection/approval handling.
- Integrate upsell prompts and pricing previews, surfacing them to reception and technician leaders for follow-through.
- Harden audit history, branch metrics, and compliance logs to satisfy dispute resolution and governance needs.

## ü§ñ Sprint 3: Intelligent & Omnichannel Check-in
- Extend check-in to mobile kiosks/QR flows, pre-arrival confirmations, and technician co-check participation.
- Introduce AI-assisted upsell recommendations and condition anomaly detection leveraging historical repair data.
- Provide real-time dashboards, SLA alerts, and experimentation hooks to continually optimize arrival throughput.

## üìã Cross-Cutting Considerations
| Topic | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Data Quality** | Align intake schema with job cards, parts, and photo storage services to prevent duplication and drift. |
| **Security & Privacy** | Ensure media uploads, signatures, and condition notes follow consent rules and branch-level access scopes. |
| **Localization** | Support bilingual intake forms, printed documents, and notification templates. |
| **Analytics** | Instrument arrival timestamps, condition selections, and upsell conversions for operations and product teams. |
| **Change Management** | Provide training collateral, quick-reference checklists, and feature toggles for phased rollout per branch. |

## ‚è±Ô∏è Total Estimated Effort
| Sprint | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Sprint 1 | ~7.5 dev days |
| Sprint 2 | ~8 dev days |
| Sprint 3 | ~8.5 dev days |

**Overall:** ~24 dev days across the first three sprints.
