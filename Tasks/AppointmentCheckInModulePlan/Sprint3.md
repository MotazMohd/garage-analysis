# ü§ñ Sprint 3: Intelligent & Omnichannel Check-in

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Evolve appointment intake into an adaptive, data-driven capability that supports self-service, predictive guidance, and continuous optimization across branches.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Self-Service & Mobile Extensions
- **QR / Kiosk Flows:** Introduce optional QR-code check-in for customers to confirm arrival, upload photos, and accept terms before reaching the desk.
- **Technician Co-Check:** Allow technician leaders to join check-in, annotate condition findings, and flag immediate parts/tool needs.
- **Device Support:** Ensure experiences work across mobile web, tablets, and dedicated kiosks with responsive UI patterns.
- **Why:** Reduces front-desk bottlenecks and engages field staff earlier in the process.

### 2. AI-Assisted Recommendations
- **Upsell Intelligence:** Train models on historical intake ‚Üí upsell conversion data to suggest high-probability services.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Highlight unusual condition entries or photo mismatches that may indicate risk, prompting supervisor review.
- **Feedback Loop:** Capture acceptance/override data to refine models and maintain transparency for staff.
- **Why:** Drives revenue and quality gains while safeguarding against intake errors.

### 3. SLA Monitoring & Experimentation
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** Visualize wait times, arrival-to-job-start intervals, and compliance scores with alert thresholds.
- **Experiment Framework:** Enable A/B or multivariate tests on intake messaging and upsell prompts with automated result analysis.
- **Playbooks:** Provide operations teams with recommended actions when KPIs degrade (e.g., redeploy staff, adjust policies).
- **Why:** Institutionalizes continuous improvement and data-backed decision making.

### 4. Ecosystem Integrations & Readiness
- **Partner Hooks:** Share arrival status with integrated partners (e.g., insurance, towing) via secure webhooks.
- **Data Warehouse Sync:** Ensure new telemetry feeds and model outputs replicate to analytics environments with lineage tracking.
- **Rollout Support:** Package change logs, training videos, and success metrics for expansion to new markets/branches.
- **Why:** Prepares the module for scaled adoption and downstream intelligence workstreams.
