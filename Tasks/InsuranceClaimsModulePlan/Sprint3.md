## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Partner API Integrations
- **Connectors:** Build integration adapters for leading regional insurers (REST/SOAP) covering claim submission, status updates, and document exchange.
- **Mapping:** Configure transformation rules and retry/backoff policies per partner.
- **Monitoring:** Instrument API call success rates, latency, and error dashboards with alerting.
- **Why:** Reduces manual data entry and accelerates decision cycles through system-to-system connectivity.

### 2. Predictive Analytics & Dashboards
- **Insights:** Surface cycle time, approval rates, supplement frequency, and recovery KPIs by insurer, branch, and service category.
- **Benchmarks:** Provide trend comparisons and highlight outliers requiring attention.
- **Self-Service:** Allow export and drill-through to claim level for finance and operations leadership.
- **Why:** Empowers data-driven adjustments and negotiation with insurers.

### 3. Smart Automation & Recommendations
- **Pre-Fill:** Suggest required documents, estimates, and communication templates based on claim type and historical outcomes.
- **Risk Flags:** Use heuristic/ML scoring to flag potential fraud, missing coverage, or high supplement likelihood.
- **Task Automation:** Auto-create follow-up tasks for expiring SLAs or payment reminders.
- **Why:** Guides teams toward proactive steps that reduce rework and protect profitability.

### 4. Cross-Module Alignment
- **Job Cards:** Sync approval results to job card steps, technician notifications, and parts reservations.
- **Finance:** Trigger invoicing, credit note creation, and reconciliation workflows automatically upon approval.
- **Customer Communication:** Update customer portals/apps with claim status milestones and required actions.
- **Why:** Ensures downstream modules stay in lockstep with claim decisions.

### 5. Rollout & Enablement
- **Playbooks:** Create enablement guides, FAQ, and sandbox scenarios for insurer partners and garage staff.
- **Feature Flags:** Allow gradual rollout per insurer or branch with telemetry on adoption and performance.
- **Support:** Set up feedback loops, office hours, and escalation paths post-launch.
- **Why:** Drives successful adoption while capturing improvement opportunities early.
