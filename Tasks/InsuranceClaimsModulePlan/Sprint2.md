# ‚öôÔ∏è Sprint 2: Decisioning & Controls

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Automate coverage validation, approval routing, and financial visibility so garages and insurers resolve claims quickly with confidence and regulatory guardrails.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Coverage Validation Engine
- **Rules:** Implement configurable rules to validate policy coverage based on service category, vehicle type, deductible, and claim limits.
- **Data Sync:** Import policy endorsements and exclusions per insurer for real-time evaluation.
- **Override:** Allow authorized managers to request exceptions with reason capture and insurer acknowledgement.
- **Why:** Reduces manual review by confirming eligibility automatically while tracking overrides.

### 2. Multi-Stage Approval Workflow
- **States:** Introduce statuses such as `Pending Assessment`, `Awaiting Insurer Decision`, `Approved`, `Rejected`, `Supplement Requested`.
- **Assignments:** Route tasks to garage estimators, insurer adjusters, and finance reviewers with due dates.
- **Automation:** Auto-advance states when required documents or approvals are completed.
- **Why:** Keeps all participants aligned on next steps and ensures nothing stalls without an owner.

### 3. Financial Ledger & Recovery Tracking
- **Breakdown:** Track approved labor, parts, paint/materials, and deductible collection per claim.
- **Integration:** Sync invoices, credit notes, and insurer payments to reconcile outstanding balances.
- **Reporting:** Surface recovery rates, outstanding balances, and write-offs per insurer and branch.
- **Why:** Provides transparent financial control and protects cashflow.

### 4. Communications Timeline & Templates
- **Timeline:** Chronicle every note, email, SMS, and portal comment in a unified chronological feed.
- **Templates:** Offer localized message templates for acknowledgements, supplement requests, and approvals with merge fields.
- **Escalations:** Highlight overdue responses and enable resend/escalate actions.
- **Why:** Centralizes collaboration history and standardizes messaging quality.

### 5. Compliance & SLA Instrumentation
- **Audit Reports:** Generate exportable audit packages with documents, approvals, and communication history.
- **SLA Dashboards:** Monitor key metrics (response time, approval time, payment time) with threshold alerts.
- **Data Retention:** Enforce retention and purge policies per insurer and regulatory requirement.
- **Why:** Demonstrates compliance readiness and gives operations early warning on SLA breaches.
