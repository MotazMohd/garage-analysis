# ðŸ§¾ Invoice & Billing â€” Sprint 1 Plan (Foundations)

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal
Establish trusted billing foundations so garages can generate compliant invoices from completed jobs and track payments reliably across branches.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Key Deliverables
1. **Invoice Data Model & Storage**
   - Introduce core entities (`Invoice`, `InvoiceLineItem`, `InvoiceAdjustment`, `PaymentRecord`).
   - Support linkage to job cards, customers, vehicles, and applied spare parts.
   - Define tax profile references for regional compliance and auditing.
2. **Invoice Generation Service**
   - Generate invoices from completed job cards with configurable sequencing rules.
   - Calculate labor, parts, shop fees, taxes, and discounts using shared pricing engines.
   - Persist invoice snapshots with versioning to capture post-generation adjustments.
3. **Draft & Approval Workflow**
   - Allow finance or branch managers to review, edit, and approve invoices before issuing.
   - Provide change tracking, notes, and status transitions (Draft â†’ Pending Approval â†’ Approved â†’ Issued).
4. **Customer Communication Templates**
   - Produce PDF and email templates with localized branding and regulatory disclosures.
   - Integrate with notification platform for delivery events and bounce/error handling.
5. **Foundational API & UI Surfaces**
   - Expose REST endpoints for listing, retrieving, and updating invoices with role-based permissions.
   - Provide initial UI screens for finance teams to search invoices and view payment status.

- **QA & UAT:** ~2 dev days (workflow scenarios, PDF validation, tax calculation accuracy).
- **Total:** ~12 dev days.
