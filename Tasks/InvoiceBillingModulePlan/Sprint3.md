# ðŸ§¾ Invoice & Billing â€” Sprint 3 Plan (Intelligence & Automation)

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal
Deliver predictive insights, advanced automation, and external integrations so invoicing operations scale across franchises with minimal manual intervention.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Key Deliverables
1. **Revenue Analytics & Forecasting**
   - Build dashboards for revenue recognition, profitability by service type, and branch comparisons.
   - Provide predictive models for cash-flow forecasting and churn risk based on payment behaviors.
   - Feed summarized metrics into enterprise BI platforms via data pipelines.
2. **Automated Dunning & Reminder Sequences**
   - Configure multi-channel reminders (email, SMS, WhatsApp) driven by aging buckets and customer profiles.
   - Support customizable cadence templates with escalation paths and suppression rules.
   - Capture communication history for compliance and dispute references.
3. **Accounting System Integrations**
   - Deliver connectors for popular ERPs/accounting suites (e.g., Xero, QuickBooks, NetSuite).
   - Sync invoices, credit notes, and payments bi-directionally with conflict resolution strategies.
   - Provide monitoring and retry mechanisms with alerting when syncs fail.
4. **Compliance & Audit Enhancements**
   - Implement digital signature/seal support for jurisdictions requiring certified invoices.
   - Offer configurable retention policies, secure archival, and tamper-proof audit logs.
   - Run automated checks for tax rate updates and apply to future invoices.
5. **Scalability & Performance Hardening**
   - Optimize invoice generation for high-volume branches (batch processing, async workflows).
   - Introduce rate limiting and throttling for API endpoints exposed to partners.
   - Conduct load testing and implement observability dashboards for billing services.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- Forecasting models produce accuracy metrics agreed with finance stakeholders.
- Automated dunning workflows trigger correctly per cadence and respect opt-out rules.
- ERP integrations sync invoices within defined SLAs and surface actionable error logs.
- Compliance controls satisfy legal sign-off for targeted markets and audits capture tamper evidence.
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed SLA targets for generation and API response times.
