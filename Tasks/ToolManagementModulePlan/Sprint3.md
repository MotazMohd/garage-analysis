# üöÄ Sprint 3: Intelligent Tool Operations

## üéØ Sprint Goal
Enhance the Tool Management module with intelligent suggestions, technician mobile workflows, and telemetry signals so garages can proactively manage tool readiness and optimize utilization across locations.

## ‚úÖ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Service & Inventory Intelligence
- **Integrations:**
  - Link tool metadata with spare part catalog to recommend required tools alongside parts in service templates.
  - Surface suggested tools during job planning based on historical service-tool associations.
- **Backend:**
  - Extend `ServiceStep` configuration to reference recommended tools with priority and quantity hints.
  - Batch job to analyze historical reservations and suggest updates to recommended tool mappings.
- **Frontend:**
  - Update service configuration UI to manage recommended tools.
  - Highlight suggested tools in job planning and allow one-click reservation creation.
- **Why:** Provides planners with contextual guidance, reducing missed tool requirements and improving preparedness.

### 2. Technician Mobile Checkout & Scanning
- **Mobile UX:**
  - Add tool checkout/check-in flow to technician mobile app (QR/barcode scan or manual lookup).
  - Display reservation queue and allow technicians to mark tools as picked up, in use, or returned.
- **APIs:**
  - `POST /api/tools/{id}/checkouts` to begin technician usage session.
  - `PUT /api/tool-checkouts/{id}/return` to close the session and update availability/condition.
- **Backend Logic:**
  - Tie checkout status into reservation lifecycle, auto-updating `ToolAvailability` and triggering maintenance checks if condition issues are reported.
- **Why:** Ensures real-time visibility into tool usage and minimizes lost or misplaced equipment.

### 3. Telemetry & IoT Hooks
- **Ingestion:**
  - Create webhook endpoint to receive usage hours and status alerts from connected tool sensors.
  - Normalize events (`usage_recorded`, `fault_detected`, `calibration_trigger`).
- **Processing:**
  - Update maintenance scheduling service to consider telemetry-driven triggers.
  - Store telemetry history for trend analysis and audit.
- **Notifications:**
  - Send urgent alerts for fault detections to supervisors and maintenance leads.
- **Why:** Enables predictive maintenance and reduces unplanned downtime.

### 4. Advanced Analytics & Insights
- **Dashboards:**
  - Expand reporting endpoint to include utilization trends, mean time between maintenance, and cross-branch sharing opportunities.
- **Data Warehouse:**
  - Publish tool usage/reservation facts to analytics pipeline (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake) for company-wide insights.
- **UI:**
  - Provide operations dashboard widgets for top under-utilized tools and upcoming maintenance windows.
- **Why:** Gives leadership actionable data to optimize capital expenditure and tool rotation.

### 5. Rollout & Change Management
- **Documentation:**
  - Produce quick start guide for technicians on mobile workflows.
  - Update admin playbooks with telemetry setup steps and recommended KPIs.
- **Training & Pilots:**
  - Run pilot with two garages, gather feedback, and iterate on UX friction points.
- **Why:** Supports smooth adoption and drives measurable value from new capabilities.
