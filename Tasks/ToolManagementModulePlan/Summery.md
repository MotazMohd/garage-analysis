# 🛠️ Tool Management Module — Delivery Plan

## 🎯 Epic Objective
Equip garages with a centralized tool registry, availability tracking, maintenance workflows, and scheduling integration so technicians always have the right equipment when they need it.

---

## 🚀 Sprint 1: Tool Registry Foundations
- Establish core entities (`Tool`, `ToolTag`, `ToolAvailability`).
- Provide CRUD APIs with validation and audit logging.
- Introduce tagging, filtering, and branch-level availability management.
- Outcome: Garages can register tools, classify them, and know where each tool is located.

## 🔧 Sprint 2: Maintenance & Reservation Workflows
- Add reservation engine to prevent double-booking of tools during job planning.
- Track maintenance/calibration logs with reminders and notifications.
- Integrate tool availability checks into service scheduling flows.
- Outcome: Tool readiness is enforced operationally with alerts and dashboards.

## 📈 Future Sprint (Preview)
- Integrate with inventory/spare parts to suggest tools alongside services.
- Add technician mobile app interfaces for checkout/check-in scanning.
- Enable IoT/telemetry hooks for tool usage monitoring and automated maintenance tickets.

## 📋 Cross-Cutting Considerations
| Topic | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Security & Permissions** | Restrict tool CRUD to SaaS Admin or Garage Admin. Supervisors can manage availability only. |
| **Soft Delete & Audit** | Use `IsActive` flag, maintain audit trails for compliance. |
| **Performance** | Index by `GarageId`, `ToolType`, `IsActive` for fast listings across large fleets. |
| **Integrations** | Expose events (`tool.created`, `tool.reservation.created`) for analytics and downstream systems. |
| **UI/UX** | Provide dashboards highlighting overdue calibration, under-utilized tools, and conflict alerts. |

## ⏱️ Total Estimated Effort
| Sprint | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Sprint 1 | ~6 dev days |
| Sprint 2 | ~6.5 dev days |
| Future Sprint | ~5 dev days (tentative) |

**Overall:** ~17.5 dev days for the first two sprints plus an optional future sprint.
